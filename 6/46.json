    "newest_commentary": "In the pursuit of salvation, a tapasv\u012b lives an austere life, a j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b cultivates knowledge, and a karm\u012b performs rituals for material gains. However, Shree Krishna declares the yogi as superior to them all. While others seek worldly attainment, the yogi strives for God. The yogi's accomplishment is at the spiritual platform, surpassing those of the tapasv\u012b, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, and karm\u012b who are still at the bodily level. The yogi's pursuit transcends material wealth and sensual pleasures, leading them closer to salvation. Through their devotion to God, the yogi attains a higher spiritual state, making them superior to others in the pursuit of salvation."
