He is also seated in everyone\u2019s heart as the Supreme Soul. In verse 18.61, Shree Krishna states: \u201cI dwell in the hearts of all living beings.\u201d Thus, within the body of each living being, there are two personalities\u2014the soul and the Supreme Soul.Those in material consciousness see everyone as the body, and make distinctions on the basis of caste, creed, sex, age, social status, etc.Those in superior consciousness see everyone as the soul. Thus in verse 5.18, Shree Krishna states: \u201cThe truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater.\u201dThe elevated yogis in even higher consciousness see God seated as the Supreme Soul in everyone. They also perceive the world, but they are unconcerned about it. They are like the hansas, the swans who can drink the milk and leave out the water from a mixture of milk and water.The most elevated yogis are called paramahansas. They only see God, and have no perception of the world. This was the level of realization of Shukadev, the son of Ved Vyas, as stated in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam:ya\u1e41 pravrajantam anupetam apeta k\u1e5bitya\u1e41dvaip\u0101yano viraha-k\u0101tara \u0101juh\u0101vaputreti tan-mayatay\u0101 taravo \u2019bhinedusta\u1e41\u00a0sarva-bh\u016bta-h\u1e5bidaya\u1e41 munim \u0101nato \u2019smi(1.2.2)[v24]When Shukadev entered the renounced order of sany\u0101s, walking away from home in his childhood itself, he was at such an elevated level that he had no perception of the world. He did not even notice the beautiful women bathing in the nude in a lake, while he happened to pass by there. All that he perceived was God; all that he heard was God; all that he thought was God.In this verse, Shree Krishna is talking about the perfected yogis who are in the third and fourth stages of the above levels of realization.\n", "next shlok": 32}
