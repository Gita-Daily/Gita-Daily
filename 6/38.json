    "commentary": "\nThe desire to attain success is natural to the j\u012bva. It comes from being a part of God, who is all-perfect, and hence the soul too wishes to be perfect and successful like its source\u2014God. Success can be attained in two realms\u2014material and spiritual. Those who consider the world to be a source of happiness strive for material advancement. And those who consider spiritual wealth to be the real treasure worthy of possessing, strive for it by rejecting material endeavors. However, if such spiritualists fail in their attempt, they are apparently left with neither spiritual nor material assets. Thinking in this manner, Arjun asks whether their position is like that of a broken cloud. A cloud, which breaks away from the group of clouds, becomes worthless. It neither offers sufficient shade, nor does it increase its weight and become rain-bearing. It merely blows in the wind and perishes like a non-entity in the sky. Arjun asks whether the unsuccessful yogi suffers a similar fate, with no position in any sphere.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "The desire for success is natural to the soul, which seeks perfection and success like God. Success can be achieved in the material or spiritual realms. Materialistic individuals strive for worldly success and happiness, while spiritual seekers value inner riches. Arjuna wonders if those who fail in their spiritual pursuits end up with nothing, like a broken cloud that lacks purpose and value. A cloud separated from the group is worthless, offering no shade or rain. Arjuna questions whether unsuccessful yogis suffer a similar fate, with no position in any realm. The commentary explores the dilemma of those who prioritize spiritual wealth over material advancement."
