The intellect of the advanced yogi becomes illumined by both j\u00f1\u0101na and vij\u00f1\u0101na. Equipped with wisdom, the yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the material energy. Such a yogi does not differentiate between objects based on their attractiveness to the self. The enlightened yogi sees all things in their relationship with God. Since the material energy belongs to God, all things are meant for his service.\nThe word ku\u1e6dastha refers to one who distances the mind from the fluctuating perceptions of senses in contact with the material energy, neither seeking pleasurable situations nor avoiding unpleasurable ones. Vijitendriya is one who has subjugated the senses. The word yukt means one who is in constant communion with the Supreme.

    "newest_commentary": "Knowledge (J\u00f1\u0101na) is obtained through listening to the Guru and studying the scriptures, while realization (Vij\u00f1\u0101na) comes from an internal awakening. An enlightened yogi sees all material objects as modifications of the energy belonging to God and doesn't differentiate based on attractiveness. One who distances the mind from sensory perceptions is called ku\u1e6dastha, and one who has subjugated the senses is vijitendriya. A yukt is in constant communion with the Supreme and experiences divine bliss, becoming fully satisfied through realized knowledge (t\u1e5bipt\u0101tm\u0101)."
