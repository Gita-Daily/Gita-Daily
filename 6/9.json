    "commentary": "\nIt is the nature of the human mind to respond differently to friends and foes. But an elevated yogi\u2019s nature is different. Endowed with realized knowledge of God, the elevated yogi see the whole creation in its unity with God. Thus, they are able to see all living beings with equality of vision. This parity of vision is also of various levels:\u201cAll living beings are divine souls, and hence parts of God.\u201d Thus, they are viewed as equal. \u0101tmavat sarva bh\u016bte\u1e63hu ya\u1e25 pa\u015bhyati sa pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\u1e25 \u201cA true Pundit is one who sees everyone as the soul, and hence similar to oneself.\u201dHigher is the vision: \u201cGod is seated in everyone, and hence all are equally respect worthy.\u201dAt the highest level, the yogi develops the vision: \u201cEveryone is the form of God.\u201d The Vedic scriptures repeatedly state that the whole world is a veritable form of God: \u012b\u015bh\u0101v\u0101syam idam sarva\u1e41 yat ki\u00f1cha jagaty\u0101\u1e41 jagat (\u012a\u015bhopani\u1e63had 1)[v2] \u201cThe entire universe, with all its living and non-living beings is the manifestation of the Supreme Being, who dwells within it.\u201d puru\u1e63ha eveda\u1e41 sarva\u1e41 (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam)[v3] \u201cGod is everywhere in this world, and everything is his energy.\u201d Hence, the highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Endowed with this level of vision, Hanuman says: s\u012by\u0101 r\u0101ma maya saba jaga j\u0101n\u012b (Ramayan)[v4] \u201cI see the face of Sita Ram in everyone.\u201dThese categories have been further detailed in the commentary to verse 6.31. Referring to all three of the above categories, Shree Krishna says that the yogi who can maintain an equal vision toward all persons is even more elevated than the yogi mentioned in the previous verse. Having described the state of Yog, starting with the next verse, Shree Krishna describes the practice by which we can achieve that state.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The nature of the human mind is to respond differently to friends and foes, but an elevated yogi sees the whole creation as unity with God. They view all living beings with equality and see them as divine souls and parts of God. At different levels, the yogi sees everyone as the soul, as God seated in everyone, and ultimately as the form of God. The Vedic scriptures affirm that the entire universe is the manifestation of the Supreme Being. The highest yogi sees everyone as the manifestation of God. Hanuman, a great yogi, sees the face of Sita Ram in everyone. Shree Krishna explains that the yogi with equal vision towards all is even more elevated. He then describes the practice by which we can attain this state of Yog."
