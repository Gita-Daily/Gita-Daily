Shree Krishna declares the bhakti yogi to be the highest, superior to even the best a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yogi and ha\u1e6dha yogi. That is because bhakti , or devotion, is the highest power of God. It is such a power that binds God and makes him a slave of his devotee. Thus, he states in the Bh\u0101gavatam:aha\u1e41 bhakta-par\u0101dh\u012bno hyasvatantra iva dvijas\u0101dhubhir grasta-h\u1e5bidayo bhaktair bhakta-jana-priya\u1e25 (9.4.63)[v27]\u201cAlthough I am supremely independent, yet I become enslaved by my devotees. They conquer my heart. What to speak of my devotees, even the devotees of my devotees are very dear to me.\u201d The bhakti yogi possesses the power of divine love, and is thus most dear to God and considered by him to be the highest of all.In this verse, Shree Krishna has used the word bhajate. It comes from the root word bhaj, which means \u201cto serve.\u201d It is a far more significant word for devotion than \u201cworship,\u201d which means \u201cto adore.\u201d Here, Shree Krishna is talking about those who, not merely adore him, but also serve him with loving devotion. They are thus established in the natural position of the soul as the servant of God, while the other kinds of yogis are still incomplete in their realization. They have connected themselves with God, but they have not yet situated themselves in the understanding that they are his eternal servants.mukt\u0101n\u0101m api siddh\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a-par\u0101ya\u1e47a\u1e25su-durlabha\u1e25 pra\u015bh\u0101nt\u0101tm\u0101 ko\u1e6di\u1e63hv api mah\u0101-mune (Bh\u0101gavatam 6.14.5)[v28]\u201cAmongst many millions of perfected and liberated saints, the peaceful person who is devoted to the Supreme Lord, Narayan, is very rare.\u201dAnother way of understanding this verse is that bhakti yog provides the closest and most complete realization of God. This is explained in verse 18.55, where Shree Krishna explains that the bhakti yogi alone understands the true personality of God.\n", "next shlok": 48}
