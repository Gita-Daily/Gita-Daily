The son is affectionately addressed as T\u0101ta. The Guru is like a father to his disciple, and hence the Guru too sometimes affectionately addresses the disciple as T\u0101ta. Here, by displaying his affection and grace toward Arjun, Shree Krishna wishes to indicate that God takes care of those who tread on his path. They are dear to God because they engage in the most auspicious kind of activity, and \u201cthe doer of good never comes to grief.\u201d This verse asserts that God preserves the devotee both in this world and the world hereafter. This pronouncement is a great assurance to all spiritual aspirants. Shree Krishna then goes on to explain how God preserves the efforts of the yogi who does not complete the journey in the present life.\n", "next shlok": 41}
