Thus, the material energy Maya is compared to darkness. It has put us in the darkness of ignorance and is making us suffer in the world. However, the darkness of Maya naturally gets dispelled when we bring the light of God into our heart. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states this very beautifully:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a s\u016brya-sama, m\u0101y\u0101 haya andhak\u0101ra y\u0101h\u0101\u00f1 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a, t\u0101h\u0101\u00f1 n\u0101hi m\u0101y\u0101ra adhik\u0101ra(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya Leela, 22.31)[v19]\u201cGod is like the light and Maya is like darkness. Just as darkness does not have the power to engulf light, similarly Maya can never overcome God.\u201d Now, the nature of God is divine bliss while the consequence of Maya is misery. Thus, one who attains the divine bliss of God can never be overcome by the misery of Maya again.Thus, the state of Yog implies both 1) attainment of bliss, and 2) freedom from misery. Shree Krishna emphasizes both successively. In the previous verse, the attainment of bliss was highlighted as the result of Yog; in this verse, freedom from misery is being emphasized.In the second line of this verse Shree Krishna states that the stage of perfection has to be reached through determined practice. He then goes on to explain how we must practice meditation.\n", "next shlok": 24}
