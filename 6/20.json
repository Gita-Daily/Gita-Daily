    "commentary": "\nHaving presented the process of meditation and the state of its perfection, Shree Krishna now reveals the results of such endeavors. When the mind is purified, one is able to perceive the self as distinct from the body, mind, and intellect. For example, if there is muddy water in a glass, we cannot see through it. However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of the \u0101tm\u0101 is only at the theoretical level. But when the mind becomes pure, the soul is directly perceived through realization.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that when the mind is purified through meditation, one can perceive the self as separate from the body, mind, and intellect. Just as muddy water in a glass becomes clear when alum is added, the mind, which obscures the perception of the soul, becomes pure. When the mind is unclean, one can only have theoretical knowledge of the self, but through purification, the soul is directly experienced and realized."
