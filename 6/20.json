When the mind is purified, one is able to perceive the self as distinct from the body, mind, and intellect. For example, if there is muddy water in a glass, we cannot see through it. However, if we put alum in the water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear. Similarly, when the mind is unclean, it obscures perception of the soul and any acquired scriptural knowledge of the \u0101tm\u0101 is only at the theoretical level. But when the mind becomes pure, the soul is directly perceived through realization.\n", "next shlok": 21}
