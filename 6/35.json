    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna responds to Arjun\u2019s comment by calling him Mah\u0101b\u0101ho, which means \u201cMighty armed one.\u201d He implies, \u201cO Arjun, you defeated the bravest warriors in battle. Can you not defeat the mind?\u201d\nShree Krishna does not deny the problem, by saying, \u201cArjun, what nonsense are you speaking? The mind can be controlled very easily.\u201d Rather, he agrees with Arjun\u2019s statement that the mind is indeed difficult to control. However, so many things are difficult to achieve in the world and yet we remain undaunted and move forward. For example, sailors know that the sea is dangerous and the possibility of terrible storms exists. Yet, they have never found those dangers as sufficient reasons for remaining ashore. Hence, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that the mind can be controlled by vair\u0101gya and abhy\u0101s.\nVair\u0101gya means detachment. We observe that the mind runs toward the objects of its attachment, toward the direction it has been habituated to running in the past. The elimination of attachment eradicates the unnecessary wanderings of the mind.\nAbhy\u0101s means practice, or a concerted and persistent effort to change an old habit or develop a new one. Practice is a very important word for s\u0101dhaks. In all fields of human endeavor, practice is the key that opens the door to mastery and excellence. Take, for example, a mundane activity such as typing. The first time people begin typing, they are able to type one word in a minute. But after a year\u2019s typing, their fingers fly on the keyboard at the speed of eighty words a minute. This proficiency comes solely through practice. Similarly, the obstinate and turbulent mind has to be made to rest on the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord through abhy\u0101s. Take the mind away from the world\u2014this is vair\u0101gya\u2014and bring the mind to rest on God\u2014this is abhy\u0101s. Sage Patanjali gives the same instruction:\nabhy\u0101sa vair\u0101gy\u0101bhy\u0101\u1e41 tannirodha\u1e25  (Yog Dar\u015bhan 1.12)[v26]\n\u201cThe perturbations of the mind can be controlled by constant practice and detachment.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "In response to Arjun's comment, Shree Krishna acknowledges that controlling the mind is challenging but not impossible. He compares it to other difficult tasks that humans overcome. Shree Krishna suggests that the mind can be controlled through detachment (vair\u0101gya) and practice (abhy\u0101s). Detachment involves eliminating attachments that lead the mind astray. Practice, on the other hand, is a persistent effort to change old habits and develop new ones. Just as mastery in typing comes through practice, the restless mind can be calmed by focusing on the Supreme Lord. Sage Patanjali also emphasizes the importance of constant practice and detachment in controlling the mind. Therefore, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that with vair\u0101gya and abhy\u0101s, the mind can be controlled."
