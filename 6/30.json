The easy way to unite the mind with God is to learn to see everything in its connection with him. For example, let us say that someone hurts us. It is the nature of the mind to develop sentiments of resentment, hatred, etc. toward anyone who harms us. However, if we permit that to happen, then our mind comes away from the divine realm, and the devotional union of our mind with God ceases. Instead, if we see the Supreme Lord seated in that person, we will think, \u201cGod is testing me through this person. He wants me to increase the virtue of tolerance, and that is why he is inspiring this person to behave badly with me. But I will not permit the incident to disturb me.\u201d Thinking in this way, we will be able to prevent the mind from becoming a victim of negative sentiments.Similarly, the mind separates from God when it gets attached to a friend or relative. Now, if we train the mind to see God in that person, then each time the mind wanders toward him or her, we will think, \u201cShree Krishna is seated in this person, and thus I am feeling this attraction.\u201d In this manner, the mind will continue to retain its devotional absorption in the Supreme.Sometimes, the mind laments over past incidents. This again separates the mind from the divine realm because lamentation takes the mind into the past and the present contemplation of God and Guru ceases. Now if we see that incident in connection with God, we will think, \u201cThe Lord deliberately arranged for me to experience tribulation in the world, so that I may develop detachment. He is so concerned about my welfare that he mercifully arranges for the proper circumstances that are beneficial for my spiritual progress.\u201d By thinking thus, we will be able to protect our devotional focus. Sage Narad states:loka h\u0101nau chint\u0101 na k\u0101ry\u0101 nivedit\u0101tma loka vedatv\u0101t (N\u0101rad Bhakti Darshan, S\u016btra 61)[v23]\u201cWhen you suffer a reversal in the world, do not lament or brood over it. See the grace of God in that incident.\u201d Our self-interest lies in somehow or the other keeping the mind in God, and the simple trick to accomplish this is to see God in everything and everyone. That is the practice stage, which slowly leads to the perfection that is mentioned in this verse, where we are never lost to God and he is never lost to us.\n", "next shlok": 31}
