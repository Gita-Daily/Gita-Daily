The rules for those who enter the renounced order of sany\u0101s state that they should not perform the ritualistic karm k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d activities; in fact they should not touch fire at all, not even for the purpose of cooking. And they should subsist on alms instead. However, Shree Krishna states in this verse that merely giving up the sacrificial fire does not make one a sany\u0101s\u012b (renunciant).Who are true yogis, and who are true sany\u0101s\u012bs? There is much confusion in this regard. People say, \u201cThis swamiji is phal\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (one who eats only fruits and nothing else), and so he must be an elevated yogi.\u201d \u201cThis b\u0101b\u0101j\u012b (renunciant) is d\u016bdh\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (subsists on milk alone), and hence he must be an even higher yogi.\u201d \u201cThis guruji is pavan\u0101h\u0101r\u012b (does not eat, lives only on the breath), and so he must definitely be God-realized.\u201d \u201cThis sadhu is a n\u0101g\u0101 b\u0101b\u0101 (ascetic who does not wear clothes), and thus he is perfectly renounced.\u201d However, Shree Krishna dismisses all these concepts. He says that such external acts of asceticism do not make anyone either a sany\u0101s\u012b or a yogi. Those who can renounce the fruits of their actions, by offering them to God, are the true renunciants and yogis.Nowadays Yoga has become the buzz word in the western world. Numerous Yoga studios have sprung up in every town of every country of the world. Statistics reveal that one out of every ten persons in America is practicing Yoga. But this word \u201cYoga\u201d does not exist in the Sanskrit scriptures. The actual word is \u201cYog,\u201d which means \u201cunion.\u201d It refers to the union of the individual consciousness with the divine consciousness. In other words, a yogi is one whose mind is fully absorbed in God. It also follows that such a yogi\u2019s mind is naturally detached from the world. Hence, the true yogi is also the true sany\u0101s\u012b.Persons who perform karm yog do all activities in the spirit of humble service to God without any desire whatsoever for rewards. Even though they may be g\u1e5bihasthas (living with a family), such persons are true yogis and the real renunciants.\n", "next shlok": 2}
