    "newest_commentary": "Once spiritual sentiments are awakened in the soul, they cannot be erased. Individuals with past and present devotional tendencies are naturally inclined towards spirituality and feel a strong pull towards God. Referred to as the 'call of God,' this inner yearning can be overwhelming. Those who experience it often forsake the world and disregard the advice of friends and family to follow their heart's calling. Throughout history, many prominent figures like princes, nobles, and wealthy individuals have abandoned their worldly comforts to become ascetics, yogis, sages, mystics, and swamis. Their sole pursuit was God, leading them to transcend the ritualistic practices of the Vedas and seek spiritual growth instead of material success."
