    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna explains in this verse the external practice for s\u0101dhan\u0101. \u015ahuchau de\u015bhe means a pure or sanctified place. In the initial stages, the external environment does impact the mind. In later stages of s\u0101dhan\u0101, one is able to achieve internal purity even in dirty and unclean places. But for neophytes, clean surroundings help in keeping the mind clean as well. A mat of Ku\u015bh grass provides temperature insulation from the ground, akin to the yoga mats of today. The deer skin atop it deters poisonous pests like snakes and scorpions from approaching while one is absorbed in meditation. If the \u0101san is too high, there is the risk of falling off; if the \u0101san is too low, there is danger of disturbance from insects on the ground. Some instructions regarding external seating given in this verse may be somewhat anachronous to modern times, in which case the spirit of the instruction is to be absorbed in the thought of God, while the instructions for the internal practice remain the same.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "This verse explains the external practice for s\u0101dhan\u0101 in the Bhagavad Gita. It emphasizes the importance of a pure and sanctified place (\u015bhuchau de\u015bhe) for beginners to maintain internal purity. Using a mat of Ku\u015bh grass and a deer skin atop it provides insulation and protection from pests during meditation. The verse mentions the importance of finding the right height for the \u0101san to avoid falling or disturbance from insects. While some instructions may be anachronistic to modern times, the essence is to be absorbed in the thought of God. The verse highlights the need for external and internal practices in s\u0101dhan\u0101."
