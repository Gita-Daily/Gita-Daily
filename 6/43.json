    "newest_commentary": "God, who resides within every being, is just and aware of our past spiritual achievements. He rewards us and nurtures our spirituality based on our previous efforts. This is why some materialistic individuals suddenly become deeply spiritual when their dormant spiritual tendencies awaken. Similarly, a traveler who rests in a hotel during a journey does not need to retrace their steps upon waking up. They continue their journey from where they left off. Similarly, with God's grace, a yogi receives their accumulated spiritual assets from past lives, allowing them to continue their spiritual journey effortlessly. Thus, a yogi never loses their spiritual progress."
