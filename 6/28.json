    "newest_commentary": "The commentary discusses the classification of happiness into four categories based on their nature: T\u0101masic, R\u0101jasic, S\u0101ttvic, and Nirgu\u1e47a. T\u0101masic happiness is derived from substances like narcotics and alcohol, as well as indulging in violence and sleep. R\u0101jasic happiness comes from satisfying the senses and the mind. S\u0101ttvic happiness is experienced through practicing virtues like compassion and knowledge, leading to self-realization. Nirgu\u1e47a happiness is the divine bliss of God, attained by the yogi who is freed from material contamination and united with God. Shree Krishna explains this highest state of perfect and infinite happiness in verses 5.21 and 6.21 of the Bhagavad Gita."
