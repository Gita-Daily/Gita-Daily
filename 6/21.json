It stems from the fact that we are tiny parts of God, who is an ocean of bliss. A number of quotations from the Vedic scriptures establishing this were mentioned in verse 5.21. Here are some more quotations expressing the nature of God as having an infinite ocean of bliss:raso vai sa\u1e25 rasa\u1e41 hyev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 nand\u012b bhavati  (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had 2.7)[v14]\u201cGod is bliss himself; the individual soul becomes blissful on attaining him.\u201d\u0101nandamayo \u2019bhy\u0101s\u0101t (Brahma S\u016btra 1.1.12)[v15]\u201cGod is the veritable form of bliss.\u201dsatya j\u00f1\u0101n\u0101nant\u0101nanda m\u0101traika rasa m\u016brtaya\u1e25  (Bh\u0101gavatam 10.13.54)[v16]\u201cThe divine form of God is made of eternity, knowledge, and bliss.\u201d\u0101nanda sindhu madhya tava v\u0101s\u0101, binu j\u0101ne kata marasi piy\u0101s\u0101 (Ramayan)[v17]\u201cGod, who is the ocean of bliss, is seated within you. Without knowing him, how can your thirst for happiness be satiated?\u201dWe have been seeking perfect bliss for eons, and everything we do is in search of that bliss. However, from the objects of gratification, the mind and senses perceive only a shadowy reflection of true bliss. This sensual gratification fails to satisfy the longing of the soul within, which yearns for the infinite bliss of God.When the mind is in union with God, the soul experiences the ineffable and sublime bliss beyond the scope of the senses. This state is called sam\u0101dhi in the Vedic scriptures. The Sage Patanjali states: sam\u0101dhisiddhir\u012b\u015bhvara pra\u1e47idh\u0101n\u0101t  (Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan 2.45)[v18] \u201cFor success in sam\u0101dhi, surrender to the Supreme Lord.\u201d In the state of sam\u0101dhi, experiencing complete satisfaction and contentment, the soul has nothing left to desire, and thus becomes firmly situated in the Absolute Truth, without deviating from it for even a moment.\n", "next shlok": 22}
