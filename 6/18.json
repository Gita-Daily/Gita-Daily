Such persons are said to be in Yog, and are free from all yearning of the senses.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nWhen does a person complete the practice of Yog? The answer is when the controlled chitta (mind) becomes fixed and focused exclusively on God. It is then simultaneously and automatically weaned away from all cravings of the senses and desires for worldly enjoyment. At that time one can be considered as yukt, or having perfect Yog. At the end of this very chapter, he also states: \u201cOf all yogis, those whose minds are always absorbed in me, and who engage in devotion to me with great faith, them I consider\u00a0to be the highest of all.\u201d (Verse 6.47)\n",
