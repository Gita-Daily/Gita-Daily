    "commentary": "\nIn the material realm, no extent of attainment satiates a person totally. A poor person strives hard to become rich, and feels satisfied if he or she is able to become a millionaire. But when that same millionaire looks at a billionaire, discontentment sets in again. The billionaire is also discontented by looking at an even richer person. No matter what happiness we get, when we perceive a higher state of happiness, the feeling of unfulfillment lingers. But happiness achieved from the state of Yog is the infinite bliss of God. Since there is nothing higher than that, on experiencing that infinite bliss, the soul naturally perceives that it has reached its goal.\nGod\u2019s divine bliss is also eternal, and it can never be snatched away from the yogi who has attained it once. Such a God-realized soul, though residing in the material body, remains in the state of divine consciousness. Sometimes, externally, it seems that the Saint is facing tribulations in the form of illness, antagonistic people, and oppressive environment, but internally the Saint retains divine consciousness and continues to relish the bliss of God. Thus, even the biggest difficulty cannot shake such a Saint. Established in union with God, the Saint rises above bodily consciousness and is thus not affected by bodily harm. Accordingly, we hear from the Puranas how Prahlad was put in a pit of snakes, tortured with weapons, placed in the fire, thrown off a cliff, etc. but none of these difficulties could break Prahlad\u2019s devotional union with God.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the material realm, no amount of attainment brings complete satisfaction. Happiness from external achievements is fleeting and leads to discontentment. However, the infinite bliss of God achieved through Yog is the ultimate goal. It surpasses all other forms of happiness and brings eternal fulfillment. Once attained, this divine bliss remains with the yogi forever, even in the face of external challenges. God-realized souls maintain a state of divine consciousness and are unaffected by bodily harm or difficulties. The example of Prahlad from the Puranas illustrates how devotion to God can endure even the most extreme hardships. Through union with God, the soul transcends bodily consciousness and finds unshakeable peace."
