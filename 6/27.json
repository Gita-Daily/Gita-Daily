    "translation": "\n\nBG 6.27:\r\n                            Great transcendental happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is calm, whose passions are subdued, who is without sin, and who sees everything in connection with God.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nAs a yogi perfects the practice of withdrawing the mind from sense objects and securing it upon God, the passions get subdued and the mind becomes utterly serene. Earlier, effort was required to focus it upon God, but now it naturally runs to him. At this stage, the elevated meditator sees everything in its connection with God. Sage Narad states:tat pr\u0101pya tad ev\u0101valokayati, tad eva \u015bh\u1e5bi\u1e47oti,tad eva bh\u0101\u1e63hayati, tad eva chintayati(N\u0101rad Bhakti Dar\u015bhan, S\u016btra 55)[v20]\u201cThe consciousness of the devotee whose mind is united in love with God is always absorbed in him. Such a devotee always sees him, hears him, speaks of him, and thinks of him.\u201d When the mind gets absorbed in God in this manner, the soul begins to experience a glimpse of the infinite bliss of God who is seated within.S\u0101dhaks often ask how they can know that they are progressing. The answer is embedded in this verse. When we find our inner transcendental bliss increasing, we can consider it as a symptom that our mind is coming under control and the consciousness is getting spiritually elevated. Here, Shree Krishna says that when we are \u015bh\u0101nta-rajasa\u1e41 (free from passion) and akalma\u1e63ham (sinless), then we will become brahma-bh\u016btam (endowed with God-realization). At that stage, we will experience sukham uttamam (the highest bliss).\n",
