But those who have brought the mind under their control through persistent effort can achieve success by adopting the proper means. The perfect process has already been described by him from verses 6.10 to 6.32. It includes subduing the senses, giving up all desires, focusing the mind upon God alone, thinking of him with an unwavering mind, and seeing everyone with equal vision.This statement creates a doubt in Arjun\u2019s mind regarding the s\u0101dhak who is unable to control the mind, and he now questions Shree Krishna in this regard.\n",
