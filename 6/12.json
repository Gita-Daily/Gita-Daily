    "translation": "There, having made the mind one-pointed, with the actions of the mind and the senses controlled, let him, seated on the seat, practise Yoga for the purification of the self.Let him firmly hold his body, head and neck erect and still, gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around.",
    "commentary": "\nHaving described the seating for meditation, Shree Krishna next describes the posture of the body that is best for concentrating the mind. In s\u0101dhan\u0101, there is a tendency to become lazy and doze off to sleep. This happens because the material mind does not initially get as much bliss in contemplation on God as it does while relishing sense objects. This creates the possibility for the mind to become languid when focused on God. Hence, you do not find people dozing off half-way through their meal, but you do see people falling asleep during meditation and the chanting of God\u2019s names. To avoid this, Shree Krishna gives the instruction to sit erect. The Brahma S\u016btra also states three aphorisms regarding the posture for meditation:\u0101s\u012bna\u1e25 sambhav\u0101t  (4.1.7)[v5] \u201cTo do s\u0101dhan\u0101, seat yourself properly.\u201dachalatva\u1e41 ch\u0101pek\u1e63hya (4.1.9)[v6] \u201cEnsure that you sit erect and still.\u201ddhy\u0101n\u0101chcha (4.1.8)[v7] \u201cSeated in this manner, focus the mind in meditation.\u201dThere are a number of meditative \u0101sans described in the Hath Yoga Pradeepika, such as padmasan, ardha padmasan, dhyanveer asan, siddhasan, and sukhasan. We may adopt any \u0101san in which we can comfortably sit, without moving, during the period of the meditation. Maharshi Pata\u00f1jali states:sthira sukham\u0101sanam (Pata\u00f1jali Yog S\u016btra 2.46)[v8]\u201cTo practice meditation, sit motionless in any posture that you are comfortable in.\u201d Some people are unable to sit on the floor due to knee problems, etc. They should not feel discouraged, for they can even practice meditation while sitting on a chair, provided they fulfill the condition of sitting motionless and erect.In this verse, Shree Krishna states that the eyes should be made to focus on the tip of the nose, and prevented from wandering. As a variation, the eyes can also be kept closed. Both these techniques will be helpful in blocking out worldly distractions.The external seat and posture do need to be appropriate, but meditation is truly a journey within us. Through meditation, we can reach deep within and cleanse the mind of endless lifetimes of dross. By learning to hold the mind in concentration, we can work upon it to harness its latent potential. The practice of meditation helps organize our personality, awaken our inner consciousness, and expand our self-awareness. The spiritual benefits of meditation are described later, in the purport on verse 6.15. Some of the side benefits are:It reins the unbridled mind, and harnesses the thought energy to attain difficult goals.It helps maintain mental balance in the midst of adverse circumstances.It aids in the development of a strong resolve that is necessary for success in life.It enables one to eliminate bad sansk\u0101rs and habits, and cultivate good qualities.The best kind of meditation is one where the mind is focused upon God. This is clarified in the next two verses.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Shree Krishna describes the posture of the body for meditation to avoid laziness and falling asleep. Sitting erect is recommended to maintain focus. Various meditative \u0101sans are available, and one can choose a comfortable one. The eyes should be fixed on the tip of the nose or kept closed to block out distractions. Meditation is an internal journey that helps cleanse the mind and awaken inner consciousness. It brings numerous benefits like harnessing thought energy, maintaining mental balance, developing a strong resolve, eliminating bad habits, and cultivating good qualities. The ultimate goal of meditation is to focus the mind on God. This is further explained in the following verses.",
