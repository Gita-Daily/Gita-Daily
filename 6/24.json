    "commentary": "\nMeditation requires the dual process of removing the mind from the world and fixing it on God. Here, Shree Krishna begins by describing the first part of the process\u2014taking the mind away from the world.\nThoughts of worldly things, people, events, etc. come to the mind when it is attached to the world. Initially, the thoughts are in the form of sphur\u1e47\u0101 (flashes of feelings and ideas). When we insist on the implementation of sphur\u1e47\u0101, it becomes sa\u1e45kalp. Thus, thoughts lead to sa\u1e45kalp (pursuit of these objects) and vikalp (revulsion from them), depending upon whether the attachment is positive or negative. The seed of pursuit and revulsion grows into the plant of desire, \u201cThis should happen. This should not happen.\u201d Both sa\u1e45kalp and vikalp immediately create impressions on the mind, like the film of a camera exposed to the light. Thus, they directly impede meditation upon God. They also have a natural tendency to flare up, and a desire that is a seed today can become an inferno tomorrow. Thus, one who desires success in meditation should renounce the affinity for material objects.\nHaving described the first part of the process of meditation\u2014removing the mind from the world\u2014Shree Krishna then talks of the second part. The mind should be made to reside upon God. He says this will not happen automatically, but with determined effort, success will come slowly.\nDetermination of resolve that is in accordance with the scriptures is called dh\u1e5biti. This determination comes with conviction of the intellect. Many people acquire academic knowledge of the scriptures about the nature of the self and the futility of worldly pursuits. But their daily life is at variance with their knowledge, and they are seen to indulge in sin, sex, and intoxication. This happens because their intellect is not convinced about that knowledge. The power of discrimination comes with the conviction of the intellect about the impermanence of the world and the eternality of one\u2019s relationship with God. Thus utilizing the intellect, one must gradually cease sensual indulgence. This is called praty\u0101h\u0101r, or control of the mind and senses from running toward the objects of the senses. Success in praty\u0101h\u0101r will not come immediately. It will be achieved through gradual and repeated exercise. Shree Krishna explains next what that exercise involves.\n",

Thoughts of worldly things lead to pursuit or revulsion, creating desires and impressions on the mind. To succeed in meditation, one must renounce attachment to material objects. The second part of meditation is making the mind reside upon God. This requires determined effort and conviction of the intellect. Many people have knowledge of spiritual teachings but fail to live according to them due to a lack of conviction. The power of discrimination comes with understanding the impermanence of the world and the eternal nature of one's relationship with God. Gradually ceasing sensual indulgence and controlling the mind and senses through praty\u0101h\u0101r is essential. Success in praty\u0101h\u0101r requires gradual and repeated practice. Shree Krishna further explains the exercise needed to achieve this.",
