    "commentary": "\nFactually, the objects of the world are made from Maya, the material energy of God. Energy is both one with its energetic and also different from it. For example, light is the energy of fire. It can be considered as different from the fire, because it exists outside it. But it can also be reckoned as a part of the fire itself. Hence, when the rays of the sun enter the room through a window, people say, \u201cThe sun has come.\u201d Here, they are bundling the sunrays with the sun. The energy is both distinct from the energetic and yet a part of it.The soul too is the energy of God\u2014it is a spiritual energy, called j\u012bva \u015bhakti. Shree Krishna states this in verse 7.5.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu stated:j\u012bva-tattva \u015bhakti, k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-tattva \u015bhaktim\u0101ng\u012bt\u0101-vi\u1e63h\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di t\u0101h\u0101te pram\u0101\u1e47a(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela, 7.117)[v19]\u201cLord Krishna is the energetic and the soul is his energy. This has been stated in Bhagavad Gita, Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47, etc.\u201d Thus, the soul is also simultaneously one with and different from God. Hence, those whose minds are fully absorbed in God-consciousness see the whole world in its unity with God as non-different from him. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:sarva-bh\u016bte\u1e63hu ya\u1e25 pa\u015bhyed bhagavad-bh\u0101vam \u0101tmana\u1e25bh\u016bt\u0101ni bhagavaty\u0101tmanye\u1e63ha bh\u0101gavatottama\u1e25(11.2.45)[v20]\u201cOne who sees God everywhere and in all beings is the highest spiritualist.\u201d For such advanced spiritualists whose minds are completely absorbed in God-consciousness, the person making the sacrifice, the object of the sacrifice, the instruments of the sacrifice, the sacrificial fire, and the act of sacrifice, are all perceived as non-different from God.Having explained the spirit in which sacrifice is to be done, Lord Krishna now relates the different kinds of sacrifice people perform in this world for purification.\n",
