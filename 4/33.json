    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now puts the previously described sacrifices in proper perspective. He tells Arjun that it is good to do physical acts of devotion, but not good enough. Ritualistic ceremonies, fasts, mantra chants, holy pilgrimages, are all fine, but if they are not performed with knowledge, they remain mere physical activities. Such mechanical activities are better than not doing anything at all, but they are not sufficient to purify the mind.Many people chant God\u2019s name on rosary beads, sit in recitations of the scriptures, visit holy places, and perform worship ceremonies, with the belief that the physical act itself is sufficient for liberating them from material bondage. However, Saint Kabir rejects this idea very eloquently:m\u0101l\u0101 pherata yuga phir\u0101, phir\u0101 na mana k\u0101 pher,kar k\u0101 manak\u0101 \u1e0d\u0101ri ke, manak\u0101 manak\u0101 pher [v27]\u201cO spiritual aspirant, you have been rotating the chanting beads for many ages, but the mischief of the mind has not ceased. Now put those beads down, and rotate the beads of the mind.\u201d Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj says:bandhan aur mok\u1e63ha k\u0101, k\u0101ra\u1e47 manahi bakh\u0101ny\u0101te kauniu bhakti karu, karu man te haridhy\u0101n(Bhakti Shatak verse 19)[v28]\u201cThe cause of bondage and liberation is the mind. Whatever form of devotion you do, engage your mind in meditating upon God.\u201dDevotional sentiments are nourished by the cultivation of knowledge. For example, let us say that it is your birthday party, and people are coming and handing you gifts. Someone comes and gives you a ragged bag. You look at it disdainfully, thinking it is insignificant in comparison to the other wonderful gifts you have received. That person requests you to look inside the bag. You open it and find a stack of one hundred notes of $100 denomination. You immediately hug the bag to your chest, and say, \u201cThis is the best gift I have received.\u201d Knowledge of its contents developed love for the object. Similarly, cultivating knowledge of God and our relationship with him nurtures devotional sentiments. Hence, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that sacrifices performed in knowledge are superior to the sacrifice of material things.  He now explains the process of acquiring knowledge.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna emphasizes the importance of knowledge in performing acts of devotion. He states that while physical acts of devotion are good, they are not sufficient for purifying the mind. Many people engage in ritualistic ceremonies and external acts of worship, believing that these alone can free them from material bondage. However, this perspective is rejected by Saint Kabir, who suggests that the mind must be engaged in devotion rather than just the physical acts. Shree Kripaluji Maharaj further explains that the mind is the cause of bondage and liberation, and devotional sentiments are nurtured by cultivating knowledge of God and our relationship with Him. Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that sacrifices performed with knowledge are superior to material sacrifices. Thus, acquiring knowledge is crucial in the process of devotion."
