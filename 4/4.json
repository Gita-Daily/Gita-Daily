    "translation": "\n\nBG 4.4:\r\n                            Arjun said: You were born much after Vivasvan. How am I to understand that in the beginning You instructed this science to him?\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nArjun is puzzled by the apparent incongruity of events in Shree Krishna’s statement. The Sun god has been present since almost the beginning of creation, while Shree Krishna has only recently been born in the world. If Shree Krishna is the son of Vasudev and Devaki, then his statement that he taught this science to Vivasvan, the Sun god appears inconsistent to Arjun, and he inquires about it. Arjun’s question invites an exposition on the concept of the divine descension of God, and Shree Krishna responds to it in the subsequent verses.\n",
