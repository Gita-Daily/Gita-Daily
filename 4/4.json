The Sun god has been present since almost the beginning of creation, while Shree Krishna has only recently been born in the world. If Shree Krishna is the son of Vasudev and Devaki, then his statement that he taught this science to Vivasvan, the Sun god appears inconsistent to Arjun, and he inquires about it. Arjun\u2019s question invites an exposition on the concept of the divine descension of God, and Shree Krishna responds to it in the subsequent verses.\n", "next shlok": 5}
