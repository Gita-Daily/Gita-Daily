The Ramayan states:samaratha kahu\u00f1 nahi\u1e45 do\u1e63hu gos\u0101\u012b\u1e45, rabi p\u0101vaka surasari k\u012b n\u0101\u012b\u1e45. [v15]\u201cPure personalities are never tainted by defects even in contact with impure situations and entities, like the sun, the fire, and the Ganges.\u201d The sun does not get tainted if sunlight falls on a puddle of urine. The sun retains its purity, while also purifying the dirty puddle. Similarly, if we offer impure objects into the fire, it still retains its purity\u2014the fire is pure, and whatever we pour into it also gets purified. In the same manner, numerous gutters of rainwater merge into the holy Ganges, but this does not make the Ganges a gutter\u2014the Ganges is pure and in transforms all those dirty gutters into the holy Ganges. Likewise, God is not tainted by the activities he performs.Activities bind one in karmic reactions when they are performed with the mentality of enjoying the results. However, God\u2019s actions are not motivated by selfishness; his every act is driven by compassion for the souls. Therefore, although he administers the world directly or indirectly, and engages in all kinds of activities in the process, he is never tainted by any reactions. Lord Krishna states here that he is transcendental to the fruitive reactions of work.Even Saints who are situated in God-consciousness become transcendental to the material energy. Since all their activities are effectuated in love for God, such pure-hearted Saints are not bound by the fruitive reactions of work. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:yat p\u0101da pa\u1e45kaja par\u0101ga ni\u1e63heva t\u1e5bipt\u0101yoga prabh\u0101va vidhut\u0101khila karma bandh\u0101\u1e25svaira\u1e41 charanti munayo \u2019pi na nahyam\u0101n\u0101stasyechchhay\u0101tta vapu\u1e63ha\u1e25 kuta eva bandha\u1e25(10.33.35) [v16]\u201cMaterial activities never taint the devotees of God who are fully satisfied in serving the dust of his lotus feet. Nor do material activities taint those wise sages who have freed themselves from the bondage of fruitive reactions by the power of Yog. So where is the question of bondage for the Lord himself who assumes his transcendental form according to his own sweet will?\u201d\n", "next shlok": 15}
