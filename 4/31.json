O best of the Kurus, those who perform no sacrifice find no happiness either in this world or the next.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe secret of sacrifice, as mentioned previously, is the understanding that it should be performed for the pleasure of God, and then the remnants can be taken as his pras\u0101d (grace). For example, devotees of the Lord partake of food after offering it to him. After cooking the food, they place it on the altar and pray to God to accept their offering. In their mind, they meditate on the sentiment that God is actually eating from the plate. At the end of the offering, the remnants on the plate are accepted as pras\u0101d, or the grace of God. Partaking of such nectar-like pras\u0101d leads to illumination, purification, and spiritual advancement.\nIn the same mood, devotees offer clothes to God and then wear them as his pras\u0101d. They install his deity in their house, and then live in it with the attitude that their home is the temple of God. When objects or activities are offered as sacrifice to God, then the remnants, or pras\u0101d, are a nectar-like blessing for the soul. The great devotee Uddhav told Shree Krishna:\n tvayopabhukta-srag-gandha-v\u0101so \u2019la\u1e45k\u0101ra-charchit\u0101\u1e25\n uchchhi\u1e63h\u1e6da-bhojino d\u0101s\u0101s tava m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 jayema hi  (Bh\u0101gavatam 11.6.46)[v26]\n\u201cI will only eat, smell, wear, live in, and talk about objects that have first been offered to you. In this way, by accepting the remnants as your pras\u0101d, I will easily conquer Maya.\u201d Those who do not perform sacrifice remain entangled in the fruitive reactions of work and continue to experience the torments of Maya.\n",
