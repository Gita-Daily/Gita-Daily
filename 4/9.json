Our mind gets cleansed by engaging it in devotional remembrance of God. This devotion can either be toward the formless aspect of God or toward his personal form. Devotion toward the formless is intangible and nebulous to most people. They find nothing to focus upon or feel connected with during such devotional meditation. Devotion to the personal form of God is tangible and simple. Such devotion requires divine sentiments toward the personality of God. For people to engage in devotion to Shree Krishna, they must develop divine feelings toward his names, form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates. For example, people purify their minds by worshipping stone deities because they harbor the divine sentiments that God resides in these deities. It is these sentiments that purify the devotee\u2019s mind. The progenitor Manu says:na k\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dhe vidyate devo na \u015bhil\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 na m\u1e5bitsu chabh\u0101ve hi vidyate devastasm\u0101tbh\u0101va\u1e41 sam\u0101charet [v8]\u201cGod resides neither in wood nor in stone, but in a devotional heart. Hence, worship the deity with loving sentiments.\u201dSimilarly, if we wish to engage in devotion toward Lord Krishna, we must learn to harbor divine sentiments toward his leelas. Those commentators who give a figurative interpretation to the Mahabharat and the Bhagavad Gita, do grave injustice by destroying the basis of people\u2019s faith in devotion toward Shree Krishna. In this verse, Shree Krishna has emphasized the need for divine sentiments toward his pastimes, for enhancing our devotion.To develop such divine feelings, we must understand the difference between God\u2019s actions and ours. We materially bound souls have not yet attained divine bliss, and hence the longing of our soul is not yet satiated. Thus, our actions are motivated by self-interest and the desire for personal fulfillment. However, God\u2019s actions have no personal motive because he is perfectly satiated by the infinite bliss of his own personality. He does not need to achieve further personal bliss by performing actions. Therefore, whatever he does is for the welfare of the materially conditioned souls. Such divine actions that God performs are termed as \u201cleelas\u201d while the actions we perform are called \u201cwork.\u201dSimilarly, God\u2019s birth is also divine, and unlike ours, it does not take place from a mother\u2019s womb. The all-Blissful God has no requirement to hang upside down in a mother\u2019s womb. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:tam adbhuta\u1e41 b\u0101lakam ambujek\u1e63ha\u1e47a\u1e41chatur-bhuja\u1e41 \u015bha\u1e45kha gad\u0101dyud\u0101yudham(10.3.9) [v9]\u201cWhen Shree Krishna manifested upon birth before Vasudev and Devaki, he was in his four-armed Vishnu form.\u201d This full-sized form could definitely not have resided in Devaki\u2019s womb. However, to create in her the feeling that he was there, by his Yogmaya power, he simply kept expanding Devaki\u2019s womb. Finally, he manifested from the outside, revealing that he had never been inside her:\u0101vir\u0101s\u012bd yath\u0101 pr\u0101chy\u0101\u1e41 di\u015bh\u012bndur iva pu\u1e63hkala\u1e25(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.3.8) [v10]\u201cAs the moon manifests in its full glory in the night sky, similarly the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna manifested before Devaki and Vasudev.\u201d This is the divine nature of God\u2019s birth. If we can develop faith in the divinity of his pastimes and birth, then we will be able to easily engage in devotion to his personal form, and attain the supreme destination.\n", "next shlok": 10}
