    "commentary": "\nHuman beings differ from each other in their natures, motivations, activities, professions, aspirations, and sansk\u0101rs (tendencies carrying forward from past lives). Shree Krishna brings Arjun to the understanding that sacrifices can take on hundreds of forms, but when they are dedicated to God, they become means of purification of the mind and senses and elevation of the soul. In this verse, he mentions three such yaj\u00f1as that can be performed.\nDravya yaj\u00f1a. There are those who are inclined toward earning wealth and donating it in charity toward a divine cause. Although they may engage in large and complicated business endeavors, yet their inner motivation remains to serve God with the wealth they earn. In this manner, they offer their propensity for earning money as sacrifice to God in devotion. John Wesley, the British preacher and founder of the Methodist Church would instruct his followers: \u201cMake all you can. Save all you can. Give all you can.\u201d\nYog yaj\u00f1a. In Indian philosophy the Yog Dar\u015bhan is one of the six philosophical treatises written by six learned sages. Jaimini wrote \u201cM\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 Dar\u015bhan,\u201d Ved Vyas wrote \u201cVed\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan,\u201d Gautam wrote \u201cNy\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan,\u201d Kanad wrote \u201cVai\u015bhe\u1e63hik Dar\u015bhan,\u201d Kapil wrote \u201cS\u0101nkhya Dar\u015bhan,\u201d and Pata\u00f1jali wrote \u201cYog Dar\u015bhan.\u201d The Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan describes an eight-fold path, called a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog, for spiritual advancement, starting with physical techniques and ending in conquest of the mind. Some people find this path attractive and practice it as sacrifice. However, Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan clearly states:\nsam\u0101dhisiddhir\u012b\u015bhvara pra\u1e47idh\u0101n\u0101t (2.45)[v24]\n\u201cTo attain perfection in Yog, you must surrender to God.\u201d So when persons inclined toward a\u1e63h\u1e6dang yog learn to love God, they offer their yogic practice as yaj\u00f1a in the fire of devotion. An example of this is the yogic system \u201cJagadguru Kripaluji Yog,\u201d where the physical postures of a\u1e63h\u1e6da\u1e45g yog are practiced as yaj\u00f1a to God, along with the chanting of his divine names. Such a combination of yogic postures along with devotion results in the physical, mental, and spiritual purification of the practitioner.\nJ\u00f1\u0101na yaj\u00f1a. Some persons are inclined toward the cultivation of knowledge. This propensity finds its perfect employment in the study of scriptures for enhancing one\u2019s understanding and love for God. s\u0101 vidy\u0101 tanmatiryay\u0101 (Bh\u0101gavatam 4.29.49)[v25] \u201cTrue knowledge is that which increases our devotion to God.\u201d Thus, studiously inclined s\u0101dhaks engage in the sacrifice of knowledge, which when imbued with the spirit of devotion, leads to loving union with God.\n",
