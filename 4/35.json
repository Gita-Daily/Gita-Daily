    "newest_commentary": "The commentary highlights that just as darkness cannot overcome the sun, once the soul attains enlightenment, illusion can never overcome it. Those who have realized God always remain in God-consciousness. Under the illusion of Maya, we perceive the world as separate from God and form relationships based on self-interest. Enlightenment brings divine knowledge, which changes our perspective. Enlightened Saints see the world as God's energy and serve God with whatever comes their way. They view all humans as parts of God and have a divine attitude towards everyone. Hanuman exemplifies this by seeing Lord Ram and Mother Sita in everyone and offering respect to all."
