    "commentary": "\nDharma is verily the prescribed actions that are conducive to our spiritual growth and progress; the reverse of this is adharma (unrighteousness). When unrighteousness prevails, the creator and administrator of the world intervenes by descending and reestablishing dharma. Such a descension of God is called an Avat\u0101r. The word \u201cAvatar\u201d has been adopted from Sanskrit into English and is commonly used for people\u2019s images on the media screen. In this text, we will be using it in its original Sanskrit connotation, to refer to the divine descension of God. Twenty four such descensions have been listed in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam. However, the Vedic scriptures state that there are innumerable descensions of God:janma-karm\u0101bhidh\u0101n\u0101ni santi me \u2019\u1e45ga sahasra\u015bha\u1e25na \u015bhakyante \u2019nusa\u1e45khy\u0101tum anantatv\u0101n may\u0101pi hi(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.51.37)[v5]\u201cNobody can count the infinite Avatars of God since the beginning of eternity.\u201d These Avatars are classified in four categories, as stated below:1. \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014when God manifests his special powers in an individual soul and acts through him. The sage Narad is an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r. The Buddha is also an example of \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r.2. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014these are the descensions of God in the personal form, where he displays some of his divine powers. Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101rs are also of two kinds:a) Where God reveals himself only for a few moments, completes his work, and then departs. Hansavatar is an example of this, where God manifested before the Kumaras, answered their question, and left.b) Where the Avatar remains on the earth for many years. Ved Vyas, who wrote the eighteen Puranas and the Mahabharat, and divided the Vedas into four parts, is an example of such an Avatar.3. Vaibhavat\u0101r\u2014when God descends in his divine form, and manifests more of his divine powers. Matsyavatar, Kurmavatar, Varahavatar are all examples of Vaibhavat\u0101rs.4. Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r\u2014when God manifests all his divine powers in his personal divine form. Shree Krishna, Shree Ram, and Nrisinghavatar are all Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r.This classification does not imply that any one Avat\u0101r is bigger than the other. Ved Vyas, who is himself an Avat\u0101r, clearly states this: sarve p\u016br\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101\u015bhvat\u0101\u015bhcha deh\u0101stasya param\u0101tmana\u1e25 (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47)[v6] \u201cAll the descensions of God are replete with all divine powers; they are all perfect and complete.\u201d Hence, we should not differentiate one Avatar as bigger and another as smaller. However, in each descension, God manifests his powers based on the objectives he wishes to accomplish during that particular descension. The remaining powers reside latently within the Avatar. Hence, the above classifications were created.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that dharma, which refers to prescribed actions for spiritual growth, opposes adharma or unrighteousness. When adharma prevails, God descends as an Avat\u0101r to restore dharma. The concept of Avat\u0101r is different from its common English usage, referring to divine descensions. While 24 Avat\u0101rs are listed in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, the Vedic scriptures suggest an infinite number. Avat\u0101rs fall into four categories: \u0100ve\u015bh\u0101vat\u0101r, where God acts through an individual with special powers; Pr\u0101bhav\u0101vat\u0101r, where God reveals himself briefly or stays on Earth for many years, like Ved Vyas; Vaibhavat\u0101r, where God manifests more divine powers, like Matsyavatar and Kurmavatar; and Par\u0101vasth\u0101vat\u0101r, where God displays all divine powers, like Shree Krishna. Ved Vyas emphasizes that all Avat\u0101rs possess divine powers and are complete. The classification is based on the objectives of each descension. However, all Avat\u0101rs have latent powers within them.",
