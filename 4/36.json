    "commentary": "\nMaterial existence is like a vast ocean, where one is tossed around by the waves of birth, disease, old age, and death. The material energy subjects everyone to the three-fold miseries: \u0101di\u0101tmik\u2014miseries due to one\u2019s own body and mind, \u0101dibhautik\u2014miseries due to other living entities, and \u0101didaivik\u2014miseries due to climactic and environmental conditions. In this state of material bondage, there is no respite for the soul, and endless lifetimes have gone by being subjected to these conditions. Like a football being kicked around the field, the soul is elevated to the celestial abodes, dropped to the hellish planes of existence, and brought back to the earthly realm, etc. according to its karmas of righteous or sinful deeds.Divine knowledge provides the boat to cross over the material ocean. The ignorant perform karmas and get bound by them. Performing the same karmas as a yaj\u00f1a to God liberates the knowledgeable. Thus, knowledge becomes the means of cutting material bondage. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had states:vij\u00f1\u0101nas\u0101rathiryastu mana\u1e25 pragrahav\u0101n nara\u1e25so \u2019dhvana\u1e25 p\u0101ram\u0101pnoti tadvi\u1e63h\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 padam (1.3.9)\u201cIllumine your intellect with divine knowledge; then with the illumined intellect, control the unruly mind, to cross over the material ocean and reach the divine realm.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "Material existence is compared to a vast ocean, where one is constantly subjected to the miseries of birth, disease, old age, and death. These miseries can be categorized as those caused by one's own body and mind, those caused by other living entities, and those caused by environmental conditions. In this state of bondage, the soul experiences an endless cycle of being elevated and dropped into different realms based on its actions. However, divine knowledge acts as a boat to navigate this ocean of material existence. Ignorant individuals perform actions that bind them further, while those who perform their actions as offerings to God attain liberation. Knowledge becomes the key to breaking free from material bondage. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had advises that one should acquire divine knowledge, use it to control the mind, and cross over the material ocean to reach the divine realm."
