Why then do they engage in activities in this world? The reason is that they wish to serve God, and are inspired to do works for his pleasure. The knowledge of the previous verse assures them that they themselves will never be bound by welfare work that is done in the spirit of devotion. They are also moved by compassion on seeing the sufferings of the materially bound souls who are bereft of God consciousness, and are inspired to work for their spiritual elevation. The Buddha once said, \u201cAfter attaining enlightenment, you have two options\u2014either you do nothing, or you help others attain enlightenment.\u201d\nThus, even sages who have no selfish motive for work still engage in activities for the pleasure of God. Working in devotion also attracts the grace of God. Shree Krishna is advising Arjun to do the same.  Having asked Arjun to perform actions that do not bind one, the Lord now begins expounding the philosophy of action.\n", "next shlok": 16}
