    "commentary": "\nIn the previous verse, Lord Krishna explained that those who truly know the divine nature of his birth and pastimes attain him. He now confirms that legions of human beings in all ages became God-realized by this means. They achieved this goal by purifying their minds through devotion. Shree Aurobindo put it very nicely: \u201cYou must keep the temple of the heart clean, if you wish to install therein the living presence.\u201d The Bible states: \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.\u201d (Matthew 5.8) [v11]Now, how does the mind get purified? By giving up attachment, fear, and anger, and absorbing the mind in God. Actually, attachment is the cause of both fear and anger. Fear arises out of apprehension that the object of our attachment will be snatched away from us. And anger arises when there is an obstruction in attaining the object of our attachment. Attachment is thus the root cause of the mind getting dirty.This world of Maya consists of the three modes of material nature\u2014sattva, rajas, and tamas (goodness, passion, and ignorance). All objects and personalities in the world come within the realm of these three modes. When we attach our mind to a material object or person, our mind too becomes affected by the three modes. Instead, when we absorb the same mind in God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, such devotion purifies the mind. Thus, the sovereign recipe to cleanse the mind from the defects of lust, anger, greed, envy, and illusion, is to detach it from the world and attach it to the Supreme Lord. Hence, the Ramayan states:prema bhagati jala binu raghur\u0101\u012b, abhiantara mala kabahu\u00f1 na j\u0101\u012b\u201cWithout devotion to God, the dirt of the mind will not be washed away.\u201d Even the ardent propagator of j\u00f1\u0101na yog, Shankaracharya, stated:\u015bhuddhayati hi n\u0101ntar\u0101tm\u0101 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47apad\u0101mbhoja bhaktim\u1e5bite (Prabodh Sudh\u0101kar)[v13]\u201cWithout engaging in devotion to the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, the mind will not be cleansed.\u201dOn reading the previous verse, a question may arise whether Lord Krishna is partial in bestowing his grace upon those who absorb their minds in him versus the worldly-minded souls. The Supreme Lord addresses this in the next verse.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of purifying the mind through devotion to attain God-realization. Attachment to material objects and people causes fear and anger, which in turn pollute the mind. By detaching from the world and attaching the mind to God, who is beyond the three modes of material nature, the mind gets cleansed. The scriptures highlight the significance of devotion in purifying the mind. Lord Krishna assures that he bestows his grace equally upon those who absorb their minds in him and the worldly-minded souls, addressing any doubts of partiality. This commentary emphasizes the need to cleanse the mind by surrendering to the divine presence within and letting go of negative emotions and attachments.",
