It is thus supremely sublime and pure. But a distinction needs to be made between two kinds of knowledge\u2014theoretical information and practical realization.\nThere is one kind of knowledge that is acquired by reading the scriptures and hearing from the Guru. This theoretical information is insufficient by itself. It is just as if someone has memorized a cookbook but has never entered the kitchen. Such theoretical knowledge of cooking does not help in satiating one\u2019s hunger. Similarly, one may acquire theoretical knowledge on the topics of the soul, God, Maya, karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, and bhakti from the Guru, but that by itself does not make a person God-realized. When one practices s\u0101dhan\u0101 in accordance with the theory, it results in purification of the mind. Then, from within one gets realization of the nature of the self and its relationship with God. The Sage Pata\u00f1jali states:\n\u015bhrut\u0101num\u0101na-praj\u00f1\u0101bhy\u0101m anya-vi\u1e63hay\u0101 vi\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101rthatv\u0101t (Yog Dar\u015bhan 1.49)[v36]\n\u201cThe knowledge attained by realization from within through the practice of Yog is far superior to theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.\u201d Such realized knowledge is being extolled by Shree Krishna as the purest sublime thing.\n", "next shlok": 39}
