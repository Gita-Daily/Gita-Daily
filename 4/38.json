    "commentary": "\nKnowledge has the power to purify, elevate, liberate, and unite a person with God. It is thus supremely sublime and pure. But a distinction needs to be made between two kinds of knowledge\u2014theoretical information and practical realization.\nThere is one kind of knowledge that is acquired by reading the scriptures and hearing from the Guru. This theoretical information is insufficient by itself. It is just as if someone has memorized a cookbook but has never entered the kitchen. Such theoretical knowledge of cooking does not help in satiating one\u2019s hunger. Similarly, one may acquire theoretical knowledge on the topics of the soul, God, Maya, karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, and bhakti from the Guru, but that by itself does not make a person God-realized. When one practices s\u0101dhan\u0101 in accordance with the theory, it results in purification of the mind. Then, from within one gets realization of the nature of the self and its relationship with God. The Sage Pata\u00f1jali states:\n\u015bhrut\u0101num\u0101na-praj\u00f1\u0101bhy\u0101m anya-vi\u1e63hay\u0101 vi\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101rthatv\u0101t (Yog Dar\u015bhan 1.49)[v36]\n\u201cThe knowledge attained by realization from within through the practice of Yog is far superior to theoretical knowledge of the scriptures.\u201d Such realized knowledge is being extolled by Shree Krishna as the purest sublime thing.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary emphasizes the distinction between theoretical knowledge and practical realization. While theoretical knowledge acquired from scriptures and Guru is important, it alone is insufficient. Just like having knowledge of cooking without entering the kitchen doesn't satiate hunger, theoretical knowledge of spiritual topics doesn't lead to God-realization. True realization comes through practicing s\u0101dhan\u0101 in accordance with the theory, which purifies the mind and leads to self-realization and understanding of the relationship with God. The Sage Pata\u00f1jali states that the knowledge attained through the practice of Yog is superior to theoretical knowledge. Shree Krishna extols this realized knowledge as the purest and sublime.",
    "newest_commentary": "The commentary highlights the importance of practical realization in addition to theoretical knowledge. While knowledge from scriptures and Guru is vital, it is incomplete without practical application. Just as knowing about cooking doesn't satisfy hunger, theoretical knowledge of spirituality doesn't lead to God-realization. True realization comes through practicing s\u0101dhan\u0101, purifying the mind, and understanding the relationship with God. Sage Pata\u00f1jali states that knowledge attained through Yog practice is superior to theoretical knowledge. Shree Krishna praises this realized knowledge as pure and sublime, emphasizing its significance."
