    "commentary": "\nSome persons are drawn to the practice of pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m, which is loosely translated as \u201ccontrol of breath.\u201d This involves:\nP\u016brak\u2014the process of drawing the breath into the lungs.\nRechak\u2014the process of emptying the lungs of breath.\nAntar kumbhak\u2014holding the breath in the lungs after inhalation. The outgoing breath gets suspended in the incoming breath during the period of suspension.\nB\u0101hya kumbhak\u2014keeping the lungs empty after exhalation. The incoming breath gets suspended in the outgoing breath during the period of suspension.\nBoth the kumbhaks are advanced techniques and should only be practiced under the supervision of qualified teachers, else they can cause harm. Yogis who are inclined toward the practice of pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m utilize the process of breath control to help tame the senses and bring the mind into focus. Then they offer the controlled mind in the spirit of yaj\u00f1a to the Supreme Lord.\nPr\u0101\u1e47 is not exactly breath; it is a subtle life force energy that pervades the breath and varieties of animate and inanimate objects. The Vedic scriptures describe five kinds of pr\u0101\u1e47as in the body\u2014pr\u0101\u1e47, ap\u0101n, vy\u0101n, sam\u0101n, ud\u0101n\u2014that help regulate various physiological bodily functions. Amongst these, sam\u0101n is responsible for the bodily function of digestion. Some people may also be inclined toward fasting. They curtail their eating with the knowledge that diet impacts character and behavior. Such fasting has been employed as a spiritual technique in India since ancient times and also considered here a form of yaj\u00f1a. When the diet is curtailed, the senses become weak and the sam\u0101n, which is responsible for digestion, is made to neutralize itself. This is the nature of the sacrifice that some people perform.\nPeople perform these various kinds of austerities for the purpose of purification. It is desire for gratification of the senses and the mind which leads to the heart becoming impure. The aim of all these austerities is to curtail the natural propensity of the senses and mind to seek pleasure in material objects. When these austerities are performed as a sacrifice to the Supreme, they result in the purification of the heart (as mentioned before, the word \u201cheart\u201d is often used to refer to the internal machinery of the mind and intellect).\n",

    "new_commentary": "Pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m, the control of breath, is practiced under qualified teachers and involves drawing breath into the lungs, emptying the lungs, holding breath, and keeping the lungs empty. Yogis use breath control to tame the senses and focus the mind on the Supreme Lord. Pr\u0101\u1e47, a subtle life force energy, is found in breath and all things. The body has five pr\u0101\u1e47as that regulate bodily functions. Fasting is practiced to weaken the senses and neutralize digestion for spiritual purposes. Austerities, including fasting, are performed to purify the heart and curb desires for sensory and mental gratification. These austerities offered as a sacrifice to the Supreme purify the heart, mind, and intellect.",
    "newest_commentary": "Pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101y\u0101m is the practice of breath control, helping yogis tame the senses and focus the mind on the Supreme Lord. Fasting weakens the senses and purifies the heart, while austerities curb desires. These practices purify the heart, mind, and intellect, and are offered as a sacrifice to the Supreme."
