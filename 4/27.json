    "commentary": "\nThere are some yogis who follow the path of discrimination, or j\u00f1\u0101na yog, and take the help of knowledge to withdraw their senses from the world. While ha\u1e6dha yogis strive to restrain the senses with brute will-power, j\u00f1\u0101na yogis accomplish the same goal with the repeated practice of discrimination based on knowledge. They engage in deep contemplation upon the illusory nature of the world, and the identity of the self as distinct from the body, mind, intellect, and ego. The senses are withdrawn from the world, and the mind is engaged in meditation upon the self. The goal is to become practically situated in self-knowledge, in the assumption that the self is identical with the Supreme Ultimate reality. As aids to contemplation, they chant aphorisms such as: tattvamasi \u201cI am That,\u201d (Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 6.8.7)[v21] and aha\u1e41 brahm\u0101smi \u201cI am the Supreme Entity.\u201d (B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had 1.4.10) [v22]\nThe practice of j\u00f1\u0101na yog is a very difficult path, which requires a very determined and trained intellect. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam (11.20.7) states: nirvi\u1e47\u1e47\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 j\u00f1\u0101nayoga\u1e25 [v23] \u201cSuccess in the practice of j\u00f1\u0101na yog is only possible for those who are at an advanced stage of renunciation.\u201d\n",
