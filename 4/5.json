The president of a country sometimes decides to visit the prison, but if we see the president standing in the jail, we do not erroneously conclude that he is also a convict. We know that he is in the jail merely for an inspection. Similarly, God sometimes descends in the material world, but he is never divested of his divine attributes and powers.In his commentary upon this verse, Shankaracharya states: y\u0101 v\u0101sudeve an\u012b\u015bhvar\u0101sarvaj\u00f1\u0101\u015bha\u1e45k\u0101 m\u016brkh\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 t\u0101\u1e41 pariharan \u015bhr\u012b-bhagav\u0101n uv\u0101cha (\u015ah\u0101r\u012brak Bh\u0101\u1e63hya on verse 4.5)[v2] \u201cThis verse has been spoken by Shree Krishna to refute foolish people who doubt that he is not God.\u201d Non-believers argue that Shree Krishna too was born like the rest of us, and he ate, drank, slept, like we all do, and so he could not have been God. Here, Shree Krishna emphasizes the difference between the soul and God by stating that although he descends in the world innumerable times, he still remains omniscient, unlike the soul whose knowledge is finite.The individual soul and the Supreme Soul, God, have many similarities\u2014both are sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal, sentient, and blissful). However, there are also many differences. God is all-pervading, while the soul only pervades the body it inhabits; God is all-powerful, while the soul does not even have the power to liberate itself from Maya without God\u2019s grace; God is the creator of the laws of nature, while the soul is subject to these laws; God is the upholder of the entire creation, while the soul is upheld by him; God is all-knowing, while the soul does not have complete knowledge even in one subject.Shree Krishna calls Arjun in this verse as \u201cParantapa,\u201d meaning \u201csubduer of the enemies.\u201d He implies, \u201cArjun, you are a valiant warrior who has slayed so many powerful enemies. Now, do not accept defeat before this doubt that has crept into your mind. Use the sword of knowledge that I am giving you to slay it and be situated in wisdom.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 6}
