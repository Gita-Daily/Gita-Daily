For those who deny the existence of God, he meets them in the form of the law of karma\u2014he sits inside their hearts, notes their actions, and dispenses the results. But such atheists too cannot get away from serving him; they are obliged to serve God\u2019s material energy, Maya, in its various apparitions, as wealth, luxuries, relatives, prestige, etc. Maya holds them under the sway of anger, lust, and greed. On the other hand, for those who turn their mind away from worldly attractions and look upon God as the goal and refuge, he takes care of them just as a mother takes care of her child.Shree Krishna uses the word bhaj\u0101mi, which means \u201cto serve.\u201d He serves the surrendered souls, by destroying their accumulated karmas of endless lifetimes, cutting the bonds of Maya, removing the darkness of material existence, and bestowing divine bliss, divine knowledge, and divine love. And when the devotee learns to love God selflessly, he willingly enslaves himself to their love. Shree Ram thus tells Hanuman:ekaikasyopak\u0101rasya pr\u0101\u1e47\u0101n d\u0101sy\u0101mi te kape\u015bhe\u1e63hasyehopak\u0101r\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 bhav\u0101m \u1e5bi\u1e47ino vaya\u1e41(V\u0101lm\u012bki Ramayan)[v14]\u201cO Hanuman, to release myself from the debt of one service you performed for me, I shall have to offer my life to you. For all the other devotional services done by you, I shall remain eternally indebted.\u201d In this way, God reciprocates with everyone as they surrender to him.If God is so merciful upon his devotees, why do some people worship the celestial gods instead? He explains in the following verse.\n", "next shlok": 12}
