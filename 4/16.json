Even intelligent persons become confused in the maze of apparently contradictory arguments presented by the scriptures and the sages. For example, the Vedas recommend non-violence. Accordingly in the Mahabharat, Arjun wishes to follow the same course of action and shun violence but Shree Krishna says that his duty here is to engage in violence. If duty varies with circumstance, then to ascertain one\u2019s duty in any particular situation is a complex matter. Yamraj, the celestial god of Death, stated:\ndharma\u1e41 tu s\u0101k\u1e63h\u0101d bhagavat pra\u1e47\u012bta\u1e41 na vai vidur \u1e5bi\u1e63hayo n\u0101pi dev\u0101\u1e25\n(\u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 6.3.19)[v17]\n\u201cWhat is proper action and what is improper action?

Dharma has been created by God himself, and he alone is its true knower.\u201d  Lord Krishna says to Arjun that he shall now reveal to him the esoteric science of action and inaction through which he may free himself from material bondage.\n", "next shlok": 17}
