Not all spiritual truths are immediately perceptible; some of them can only be experienced after having attained sufficient elevation on the path. If we only accept what we can presently verify or comprehend, we will be bereft of the higher spiritual secrets. Faith helps us accept what we cannot understand at present. Jagadguru Shankaracharya has defined faith as follows:guru ved\u0101nta v\u0101kye\u1e63hu d\u1e5bi\u1e0dho vi\u015bhv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhraddh\u0101 [v37]\u201cFaith means firm confidence in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\u201d When such faith is placed upon a wrong personality, it can lead to disastrous consequences. But when it is placed on the true Guru, it opens the pathway for eternal welfare.However, blind faith is not a desirable thing. Before placing it on any Guru, we must use our intellect to confirm that the Guru has realized the Absolute Truth, and he is teaching it in accordance with the eternal Vedic scriptures. Once this is confirmed, then we should strive to deepen our faith in such a Guru, and surrender to God under his guidance. The Shvetashvatar Upani\u1e63had states:yasya deve par\u0101 bhaktir\u00a0yath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hyarth\u0101\u1e25 prak\u0101\u015bhante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25(6.23)[v38]\u201cThe imports of all the Vedic knowledge is revealed within the hearts of those who engage with unflinching faith in devotion toward Guru and God.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 40}
