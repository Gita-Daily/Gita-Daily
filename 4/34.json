    "commentary": "\nOn hearing that sacrifice should be performed in knowledge, the natural question that follows is, how can we obtain spiritual knowledge? Shree Krishna gives the answer in this verse. He says: 1) Approach a spiritual master. 2) Inquire from him submissively. 3) Render service to him.The Absolute Truth cannot be understood merely by our own contemplation. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:an\u0101dyavidy\u0101 yuktasya puru\u1e63hasy\u0101tma vedanamsvato na sambhav\u0101d anyas tattva-j\u00f1o j\u00f1\u0101na-do bhavet(11.22.10)[v29]\u201cThe intellect of the soul is clouded by ignorance from endless lifetimes. Covered with nescience, the intellect cannot overcome its ignorance simply by its own effort. One needs to receive knowledge from a God-realized Saint who knows the Absolute Truth.\u201dThe Vedic scriptures advise us repeatedly on the importance of the Guru on the spiritual path.\u0101ch\u0101ryav\u0101n puru\u1e63ho veda\u1e25(Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 6.14.2)[v30]\u201cOnly through a Guru can you understand the Vedas.\u201d The Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b states:tatp\u0101d\u0101mburu hadvandva sev\u0101 nirmala chetas\u0101msukhabodh\u0101ya tattvasya viveko \u2019ya\u1e41 vidh\u012byate(1.2)[v31]\u201cServe the Guru with a pure mind, giving up doubts. He will then bring you great happiness by bestowing knowledge of the scriptures and discrimination.\u201d Jagadguru Shankaracharya stated: y\u0101vat gururna kartavyo t\u0101vanmuktirna labhyate[v32] \u201cUntil you surrender to a Guru you cannot be liberated from the material energy.\u201dOne of the most magnanimous graces of God is when he brings the soul in contact with a true Guru. But the process of transfer of spiritual knowledge from the teacher to the student is very different from that of material knowledge. Secular education does not require deep respect for the teacher. The transmission of knowledge can be purchased simply by paying the teacher\u2019s fees. However, spiritual edification is not imparted to the student by a mechanical teaching process, nor is it purchased for a price. It is revealed in the heart of the disciple by the Guru\u2019s grace, when the disciple develops humility, and the Guru is pleased with the service attitude of the disciple. That is why Prahlad Maharaj said:nai\u1e63h\u0101\u1e41 matis t\u0101vad urukram\u0101\u1e45ghri\u1e41 sp\u1e5bi\u015bhatyanarth\u0101pagamo yadartha\u1e25mah\u012byas\u0101\u1e41 p\u0101da rajo \u2019bhi\u1e63heka\u1e41 ni\u1e63hki\u00f1chan\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 na v\u1e5bi\u1e47\u012bta y\u0101vat(Bh\u0101gavatam 7.5.32)[v33]\u201cUntil we bathe ourselves in the dust of the lotus feet of a Saint, we can never have an experience of the transcendental platform.\u201d Hence, in this verse Shree Krishna mentions the need for approaching a Guru with reverence, inquiring about the Truth from him with humility, and pleasing him by rendering service.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains how to obtain spiritual knowledge. He advises approaching a spiritual master, inquiring submissively, and serving the Guru. The Absolute Truth cannot be understood through self-contemplation alone. The soul's intellect is clouded by ignorance and can only be purified by receiving knowledge from a God-realized Saint. The Guru plays a crucial role in understanding the Vedas and scriptures. Serving the Guru with a pure mind brings great happiness and knowledge. Surrendering to a Guru is essential for liberation from material energy. Unlike secular education, spiritual knowledge is not obtained through a mechanical teaching process or by paying fees but requires the Guru's grace and the disciple's humility and service. Prahlad Maharaj emphasizes the importance of bathing in the dust of a Saint's lotus feet to experience the transcendental platform. Therefore, Shree Krishna stresses the need for approaching the Guru with reverence, inquiring humbly, and serving devotedly."
