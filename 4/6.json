    "commentary": "\nMany people revolt at the idea of a God who possesses a form. They are more comfortable with a formless God, who is all-pervading, incorporeal, and subtle. God is definitely incorporeal and formless, but that does not mean that he cannot simultaneously have a form as well. Since God is all-powerful, he has the power to manifest in a form if he wishes. If someone stipulates that God cannot have a form, it means that person does not accept him as all-powerful. Thus to say, \u201cGod is formless,\u201d is an incomplete statement. On the other hand, to say, \u201cGod manifests in a personal form,\u201d is also only a partial truth. The all-powerful God has both aspects to his divine personality\u2014the personal form and the formless aspect. Hence, the B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:dwe v\u0101va brahma\u1e47o r\u016bpe m\u016brta\u1e41 chaiva am\u016brta\u1e41 cha  (2.3.1)[v3]\u201cGod appears in both ways\u2014as the formless Brahman and as the personal God.\u201d They are both dimensions of his personality.In fact, the individual soul also has these two dimensions to its existence. It is formless, and hence, when it leaves the body upon death, it cannot be seen. Yet it takes on a body\u2014not once, but innumerable times\u2014as it transmigrates from birth to birth. When the tiny soul is able to possess a body, can the all-powerful God not have a form? Or is it that God says, \u201cI do not have the power to manifest in a form, and hence I am only a formless light.\u201d For him to be perfect and complete, he must be both personal and formless.The difference is that while our form is created from the material energy, Maya, God\u2019s form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is thus divine, and beyond material defects. This has been nicely stated in the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47:yastu nirgu\u1e47a ityukta\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101stre\u1e63hu jagad\u012b\u015bhvara\u1e25pr\u0101k\u1e5bitairheya sanyuktairgu\u1e47airh\u012bnatvamuchyate  [v4]\u201cWherever the Vedic scriptures state that God does not have a form, they imply that his form is not subject to the blemishes of the material energy; rather, it is a divine form.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "Many people prefer to believe in a formless God, but God can have both a form and be formless. Saying 'God is formless' is incomplete as it ignores his all-powerfulness. Similarly, saying 'God manifests in a personal form' is also partially true. The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad states that God appears in both ways, as the formless Brahman and as the personal God. The individual soul also has formless and embodied dimensions. Our form is created from material energy, but God's form is created by his divine energy, Yogmaya. It is divine and beyond material defects. When the Vedic scriptures say God is formless, it means his form is not subject to material blemishes; it is a divine form.",
