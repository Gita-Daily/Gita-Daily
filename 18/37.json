    "commentary": "\nThe Indian gooseberry (\u0101ml\u0101) is one of those super-foods that are very beneficial for health. It has the Vitamin C of more than 10 oranges. But children dislike it, since it has a bitter taste. Parents in North India encourage children to eat it, saying: \u0101mle k\u0101 kh\u0101y\u0101 aur ba\u1e0do\u1e45 k\u0101 kah\u0101, b\u0101d me\u1e45 pat\u0101 chalat\u0101 hai [v20.1] \u201cThe benefits of both these\u2014eating of \u0101ml\u0101 and the advice of the elders\u2014are experienced in the future.\u201d Interestingly, after eating the \u0101ml\u0101, in just a couple of minutes, the bitter taste disappears and sweetness is experienced. And the long-term benefits of consuming the natural Vitamin C are undoubtedly numerous. In the above verse, Shree Krishna says that happiness in the mode of goodness is of the same nature; it seems bitter in the short-run, but it tastes like nectar in the end.The Vedas refer to happiness in the mode of goodness as \u015bhreya, which is unpleasant in the present but ultimately beneficial. In contrast to this is preya, which is pleasant in the beginning but ultimately harmful. Regarding \u015bhreya and preya, the Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had states:anyachchhreyo \u2019nyadutaiva preyaste ubhe n\u0101n\u0101rthe puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 sin\u012bta\u1e25tayo\u1e25 \u015bhreya \u0101dad\u0101nasya s\u0101dhu bhavati h\u012byate \u2019rth\u0101dya u preyo v\u1e5bi\u1e47\u012bte\u015bhreya\u015bhcha preya\u015bhcha manu\u1e63hyametastau sampar\u012btya vivinakti dh\u012bra\u1e25\u015bhreyo hi dh\u012bro \u2019bhi preyaso v\u1e5bi\u1e47\u012bte preyo mando yogak\u1e63hem\u0101d v\u1e5bin\u012bte (1.2.1-2)[v21]\u201dThere are two paths\u2014one is the \u2018beneficial\u2019 and the other is the \u2018pleasant\u2019. These two lead humans to very different ends. The pleasant is enjoyable in the beginning, but it ends in pain. The ignorant are snared to the pleasant and perish. But the wise are not deceived by its attractions, choose the beneficial, and finally attain happiness.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, the Indian gooseberry (\u0101ml\u0101) is used as an analogy to explain the concept of happiness in the mode of goodness. Just like \u0101ml\u0101, which initially tastes bitter but becomes sweet and has long-term health benefits, happiness in the mode of goodness may seem unpleasant at first but ultimately brings great benefits. The Vedas describe this type of happiness as \u015bhreya, which is initially unpleasant but leads to true happiness and well-being. On the other hand, there is preya, which brings immediate pleasure but leads to harmful consequences in the long run. The commentary emphasizes the importance of choosing the path of \u015bhreya, which is ultimately more fulfilling and beneficial, rather than getting swayed by the temporary allure of preya.",
