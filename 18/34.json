    "translation": "\n\nBG 18.34:\r\n                            The steadfast willpower by which one holds on to duty, pleasures, and wealth, out of attachment and desire for rewards, O Arjun, is determination in the mode of passion.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nDetermination is not found exclusively in yogis. Worldly-minded people are also staunchly determined in their pursuits. However, their determination is fanned by their desire to delight in the fruits of their efforts. They are focused on enjoying sensual pleasures, acquiring wealth, etc. And since money is the means for acquiring these, such people cling to money for their very life. Shree Krishna says that determination fuelled by the desire for enjoying rewards is in the mode of passion.\n",
