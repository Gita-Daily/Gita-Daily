    "commentary": "\nKavaya\u1e25 are the learned. Shree Krishna states that learned people consider sany\u0101s as the renunciation of works. Those who renounce works for material enjoyment and enter the renounced order are called karm sany\u0101s\u012bs. They continue to do some of the nitya karm (daily works for the maintenance of the body), but they renounce k\u0101mya karm (works related to acquisition of wealth, progeny, prestige, status, power, etc). Such works bind the soul further in the wheel of karma and lead to repeated rebirths in the samsara of birth and death.\nVichak\u1e63ha\u1e47\u0101\u1e25 are the wise. Shree Krishna states that wise people lay emphasis on ty\u0101g, meaning \u201cinternal renunciation.\u201d This implies not relinquishing the prescribed Vedic duties, rather renouncing the desires for enjoying their fruits. Therefore, the attitude of giving up attachment to the rewards of actions is ty\u0101g, while the attitude of giving up works is sanyas. Both sany\u0101s and ty\u0101g seem plausible and reasonable options to pursue for enlightenment. Of these two courses of action, which one does Shree Krishna recommend? He provides more clarity on this topic in the subsequent verses.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna distinguishes between sany\u0101s and ty\u0101g. Sany\u0101s is the renunciation of works, where individuals renounce works for material enjoyment and enter the renounced order. They continue some daily works but renounce works related to acquisition of wealth, progeny, prestige, etc. On the other hand, ty\u0101g is internal renunciation, where wise individuals give up attachment to the rewards of actions while still performing their prescribed duties. Both sany\u0101s and ty\u0101g are plausible options for enlightenment. Shree Krishna provides more clarity on this topic in the subsequent verses."
