But the substratum behind this apparent diversity is the Supreme Lord. Those who possess this vision of knowledge see the unity that exists behind the variety of creation, just as an electrical engineer sees the same electricity flowing through different gadgets, and a goldsmith sees the same gold cast into different ornaments. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattva\u1e41 yaj j\u00f1\u0101nam advayam (1.2.11)[v15]\u201cKnowers of the truth have stated that there is only one entity in existence, without a second.\u201d Chaitanya Mahaprabhu referred to God, in his form as Shree Krishna, as advaya j\u00f1\u0101na tattva [v16] (one without a second, the only thing and everything that exists in creation), on the basis of the following four criteria:1. Saj\u0101t\u012bya bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (He is one with all similar entities.) Shree Krishna is one with the various other forms of God, such as Ram, Shiv, Vishnu, etc. since these are different manifestations of the one God.Shree Krishna is also one with the souls, who are his tiny fragmental parts. A fragment is one with its whole, just as flames are one with the fire of which they are tiny parts.2. Vij\u0101t\u012bya bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (He is one with all dissimilar entities.) Dissimilar to God is Maya, which is insentient, while God is sentient. However, Maya is an energy of God, and energy is one with its energetic, just as the energies of fire\u2014heat and light\u2014are non-different from it.3. Swagat bhed \u015bh\u016bnya. (The various parts of his body are non-different from him.) The amazing thing about God\u2019s body is that all the parts perform the functions of all the other parts. The Brahma Samhit\u0101 states:a\u1e45g\u0101ni yasya sakalendriya-v\u1e5bitti-manti pa\u015bhyanti p\u0101nti kalayanti chira\u1e41 jaganti (5.32)[v17]\u201cWith every limb of his body, God can see, hear, talk, smell, eat, and think.\u201d Hence, all the limbs of God\u2019s body are non-different from him.4. Swayam siddha. (He needs the support of no other entity.) Maya and the soul are both dependent upon God for their existence. If he did not energize them, they would cease to exist. On the other hand, God is supremely independent and does not need the support of any other entity for his existence.The Supreme Lord Shree Krishna satisfies all the four above points, and thus he is the advaya j\u00f1\u0101na tattva, in other words, he is everything that exists in creation. With this understanding, when we see the entire creation in its unity with God, it is considered s\u0101ttvic knowledge. And love based upon such knowledge is not racial or national, rather it is universal.\n", "next shlok": 21}
