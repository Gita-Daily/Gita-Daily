Before sharing it, he considers many things, such as the preparedness of the student to receive it, comprehend it, benefit from it, etc. In the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun was bewildered by the problems facing him and asked for guidance from Shree Krishna. The Lord enlightened him with great care and consideration, uplifting his understanding a little by little, through the eighteen chapters. Having seen Arjun receive the message so well, Shree Krishna now feels confident that he will be able to grasp the final and most profound knowledge as well. Further, he says i\u1e63h\u1e6do \u2018si me d\u1e5bi\u1e0dhamiti, meaning, \u201cI am speaking this to you because you are my very dear friend. So I care for you deeply and sincerely desire your best interest.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 65}
