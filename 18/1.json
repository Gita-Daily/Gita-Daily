O Hrishikesh, I also wish to know the distinction between the two, O Keshinisudan.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nArjun addresses Shree Krishna as \u201cKeshi-nisudan,\u201d meaning \u201ckiller of the Keshi demon.\u201d In his divine pastimes on the earth, Lord Krishna had killed a furious and violent demon called Keshi, who had taken the form of a mad horse and created havoc in the land of Braj. Doubt is also like an untamed horse that runs wild in the mind and destroys the garden of devotion. Arjun indicates, \u201cJust as you slayed the Keshi demon, please slay the demon of doubt in my mind.\u201d His question is penetrating and poignant. He wishes to know the nature of sany\u0101s, which means \u201crenunciation of actions.\u201d He also wishes to know the nature of ty\u0101g, which means \u201crenunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions.\u201d Further, he uses the word p\u1e5bithak, meaning difference; he wishes to understand the distinction between the two terms. Arjun also refers to Shree Krishna as Hrishikesh, meaning \u201cmaster of the senses.\u201d Arjun\u2019s goal is to accomplish the greatest of conquests, which is to subdue the mind and the senses. It is this conquest that can bestow the state of perfect peace. And the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, as the Master of the senses, himself embodies this state of perfection.This topic had been explained in the previous chapters as well. Shree Krishna had talked about sany\u0101s in verses 5.13 and 9.28, and about ty\u0101g in verses 4.20 and 12.11, but he explains it here from another angle. The same truth permits itself to be presented from a variety of perspectives and each perspective provides its own unique appeal. For example, various sections of a garden leave differing impressions on the viewer\u2019s mind, while the entire garden creates yet another impression. The Bhagavad Gita is very much like this. Each chapter is designated as a particular Yog, while the eighteenth chapter is considered the synopsis. In this chapter, Shree Krishna briefly summarizes the perennial principles and eternal truths that were presented in the previous seventeen chapters and establishes the collective conclusion of all of them. After discussing the topics of renunciation and detachment, he goes on to explain the natures of the three gu\u1e47as and how they affect people\u2019s natural propensities for work. He reiterates that the mode of goodness is the only mode worthy of cultivation. He then concludes that bhakti, or exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord is the paramount duty, and its attainment is the goal of human life.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary of the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun addresses Krishna and seeks clarification on the nature of sany\u0101s (renunciation of actions) and ty\u0101g (renunciation of desires for enjoying the fruits of actions). Arjun refers to Krishna as the 'killer of the Keshi demon', symbolizing his request to slay the demon of doubt in his mind. Arjun's goal is to conquer the mind and senses for inner peace, and Krishna, as the 'master of the senses', embodies this state. The chapter serves as a synopsis, summarizing the perennial principles and eternal truths presented in the previous chapters. Krishna explains the natures of the three gu\u1e47as (modes of material nature) and emphasizes the cultivation of the mode of goodness. He concludes that bhakti, exclusive loving devotion to the Supreme Lord, is the paramount duty and the goal of human life."
