Shree Krishna told him that he was showing him the universal form because Arjun was his devotee and friend, and thus very dear to him. Sanjay also came to see that cosmic form because he was fortunate to be a part of the divine pastimes as the narrator. There are times when an unexpected grace comes our way. If we utilize it properly, we can progress rapidly in our s\u0101dhan\u0101. Sanjay is repeatedly contemplating upon what he saw and flowing in the current of devotion.\n",
