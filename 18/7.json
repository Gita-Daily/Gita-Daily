    "commentary": "\nRenouncing prohibited actions and unrighteous actions is proper; renouncing desire for the rewards of actions is also proper; but renouncing prescribed duties is never proper. Prescribed duties help purify the mind and elevate it from tamo gu\u1e47a to rajo gu\u1e47a to sattva gu\u1e47a. Abandoning them is an erroneous display of foolishness. Shree Krishna states that giving up prescribed duties in the name of renunciation is said to be in the mode of ignorance.\nHaving come in this world, we all have obligatory duties. Fulfilling them helps develop many qualities in an individual, such as responsibility, discipline of the mind and senses, tolerance of pain and hardships, etc. Abandoning them, out of ignorance, leads to the degradation of the soul. These obligatory duties vary according to one\u2019s level of consciousness. For an ordinary person, acts such as earning wealth, taking care of the family, bathing, eating, etc. are prescribed duties. As one gets elevated, these obligatory duties change. For an elevated soul, sacrifice, charity, and penance are the duties.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Renouncing prohibited and unrighteous actions is proper, but renouncing prescribed duties is never proper. Prescribed duties purify the mind and elevate it. Abandoning them is foolish and in the mode of ignorance. Fulfilling obligatory duties develops qualities like responsibility and discipline. Ignorantly abandoning these duties degrades the soul. Obligatory duties vary as per one's consciousness level. For an ordinary person, duties include earning wealth and taking care of family. As one elevates, duties change to sacrifice, charity, and penance."
