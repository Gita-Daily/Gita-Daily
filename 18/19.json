    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna once again refers to the three modes of nature. In chapter 14, he had given an introduction about these modes, and described how they bind the soul to the samsara of life and death. Then in chapter 17, he went into great detail about how these three modes influence the kinds of faith people develop and also their choice of foods. He also explained the three categories of sacrifice, charity, and penance. Here, according to the three gu\u1e47as, the Lord will explain the three types of knowledge, action, and doers.\nAmongst the six systems of thought in Indian philosophy, the S\u0101nkhya philosophy (also called puru\u1e63h prak\u1e5biti v\u0101da) is recognized as the authority in the matter of analysis of material nature. It considers the soul as the puru\u1e63h (lord), and thus recognizes many puru\u1e63has. Prak\u1e5biti is the material nature and includes all things made from it. S\u0101nkhya states the cause for misery is the desire of the puru\u1e63h to enjoy prak\u1e5biti. When this enjoying propensity subsides, then the puru\u1e63h is released from the bondage of material nature attains eternal beatitude. The S\u0101nkhya system does not acknowledge the existence of the Param Puru\u1e63h, or the Supreme Lord, and hence it is insufficient for knowing the Absolute Truth. However, in the matter of knowledge about prak\u1e5biti (material nature), Shree Krishna refers to it as the authority.\n",
