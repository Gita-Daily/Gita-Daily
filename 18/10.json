    "translation": "\n\nBG 18.10:\r\n                            Those who neither avoid disagreeable work nor seek work because it is agreeable are persons of true renunciation. They are endowed with the quality of the mode of goodness and have no doubts (about the nature of work).\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nPeople who are situated in s\u0101ttvic renunciation are not miserable in disagreeable circumstances; nor do they get attached to situations that are agreeable to them. They simply do their duty under all conditions, without feeling elated when the going is good or feeling dejected when life becomes tough. They are not like a dry leaf that is tossed hither and tither by every passing breeze. Instead, they are like the reeds in the sea, gently negotiating every rising and falling wave. While retaining their equanimity and without succumbing to anger, greed, envy, or attachment, they watch the waves of events rising and falling around them. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was a scholar of the Bhagavad Gita and a famous karm yogi. Before Mahatma Gandhi came on the scene, he was at the forefront of the freedom struggle of India. He was asked what position he would choose if India became independent\u2014Prime Minister or Foreign Minister? He replied, \u201cMy ambition was to write a book on Differential Calculus. I will fulfill it.\u201d Once, the police arrested him for creating unrest. He asked his friend to find out the provisions under which he was arrested, and to inform him in prison. When the friend reached him after an hour, he was fast asleep in the jail. Another time, he was working in his office, and his clerk brought him the news that his elder son was seriously ill. Instead of getting emotionally wrought, he asked the clerk to get a doctor, and he continued working. Half an hour later, his friend came and conveyed the same news. He said, \u201cI have called for the doctor to see him. What else can I do?\u201d These instances reveal how he retained his composure despite being in the midst of tumultuous situations. He was able to continue performing his actions because of the internal emotional composure; had he been emotionally distressed he would have been unable to sleep in the jail cell or concentrate on his work at the office.\n",

    "new_commentary": "People who practice s\u0101ttvic renunciation do not suffer in challenging situations nor get attached to pleasant ones. They carry out their responsibilities without getting elated or dejected. They remain calm and unaffected, like reeds in the sea. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a renowned karm yogi and scholar of the Bhagavad Gita, exemplified this. Despite being a leader in India's freedom struggle, he prioritized his personal ambitions over political positions. When arrested, he peacefully slept in jail. When told of his son's illness, he calmly arranged for a doctor. Tilak's ability to maintain composure in chaotic situations allowed him to fulfill his duties without being emotionally disturbed."
