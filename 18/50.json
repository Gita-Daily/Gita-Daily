It is said that good ideas are a dime a dozen, but they are not worth a plug nickel if you don\u2019t act on them. The theoretical Pundits may have knowledge of all the scriptures in their head, but still be bereft of realization. On the other hand, the karm yogis get opportunities day and night to practice the truths of the scriptures. Thus, the consistent performance of karm yog results in the realization of spiritual knowledge. And when one attains the perfection of nai\u1e63hkarmya-siddhi, or actionlessness while performing work, transcendental knowledge becomes available through experience. Fixed in that knowledge, the karm yogi attains the highest perfection of God-realization. Shree Krishna explains how this happens in the next verse few verses.\n", "next shlok": 51}
