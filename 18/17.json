He says that those with purified intellect are free from the false pride of being the doer. They also do not seek to enjoy the fruits of their actions. Thus, they are not bound in the karmic reactions of what they do. Previously in verse 5.10 as well, he had stated that those who are detached from results are never tainted by sin. From a material perspective, they may appear to be working, but from a spiritual perspective, they are free from selfish motivations, and therefore they do not become bound by the results of karma.Rahim Khankhana was a famous poet saint, during the Mughal period in Indian history. Although a Muslim by birth, he was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. When he would give alms in charity, he would lower his eyes. A sweet incident is related about this habit of his. It is said that Saint Tulsidas heard of Rahim\u2019s style of giving alms, and asked him:ais\u012b den\u012b dena jyu\u00f1, kita s\u012bkhe ho sainajyo\u1e45 jyo\u1e45 kara \u016b\u00f1chyo karo, tyo\u1e45 tyo\u1e45 niche naina [v13]\u201cSir, where did you learn to give alms like this? Your hands are as high as your eyes are low.\u201d Rahim replied beautifully and in all humbleness:denah\u0101ra ko\u012b aur hai, bhejata hai dina rainaloga bharama hama para kare\u1e45, y\u0101te niche naina [v14]\u201cThe giver is someone else, giving day and night. But the world gives me the credit, and so I lower my eyes.\u201d Understanding that we are not the sole cause responsible for our accomplishments frees us from the egoistic pride of doership.\n", "next shlok": 18}
