    "commentary": "\nIn his systematic treatment of the science of action, Shree Krishna explained its limbs. He also explained the karmic reactions of actions, and the process of becoming free from them. Now, he discusses the three-fold factors that propel actions. These are j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge), j\u00f1eya (the object of knowledge), and j\u00f1\u0101t\u0101 (the knower). Together, the three are called the j\u00f1\u0101na tripu\u1e6d\u012b (triad of knowledge).\n\u201cKnowledge\u201d is a primary impetus for action; it provides understanding to the \u201cknower\u201d about the \u201cobject of knowledge.\u201d This triad jointly induces action. For example, knowledge of the remuneration to be paid by the employer motivates employees to work; information of the discovery of gold in various parts of the world led to gold rushes involving feverish migration by workers; awareness of the importance of winning a medal in the Olympics motivates sportspersons to practice for years. Knowledge also has a correlation to the quality of work. For instance, a degree from a top college carries weight in the job market. Corporations realize that people with higher quality knowledge can perform work more proficiently. That\u2019s why good corporations invest in the development of their people, such as sponsoring employees for developmental seminars to further advance their skill set.\nThe second set named is the karm tripu\u1e6d\u012b (triad of action). It includes the kart\u0101 (doer), k\u0101ra\u1e47 (the instrument of action), and karm (the act itself). This triad of work jointly constitutes the content of action. The \u201cdoer\u201d utilizes the \u201cinstruments of action\u201d to perform \u201cthe action.\u201d Having analyzed the constituents of action, Shree Krishna now relates them to the three modes of material nature, to explain why people differ from each other in their motives and actions.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna discusses the three factors that drive actions: knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the knower. These three together form the j\u00f1\u0101na tripu\u1e6d\u012b. Knowledge plays a crucial role in motivating individuals to act, as it provides understanding about the object of knowledge. For example, knowledge about remuneration motivates employees to work, and awareness of gold discoveries led to feversh migration. Knowledge also correlates with the quality of work, with degrees from top colleges carrying weight in the job market. The second set, karm tripu\u1e6d\u012b, includes the doer, the instrument of action, and the act itself. These three constitute the content of action. Shree Krishna relates these constituents to the three modes of material nature, explaining the differences in motives and actions among people."
