    "commentary": "\nSome philosophers, such as those of the S\u0101nkhya school of thought, are in favor of liquidating mundane life as quickly as possible. They opine that all actions should be abandoned because they are motivated by desire, which promotes further transmigration in the cycle of life and death. They contend that all works are subject to inherent defects, such as indirect violence. For example, if one lights a fire, there is always the possibility of insects getting involuntarily burnt in it. Hence, they recommend the path of cessation of all actions, except those for the sustenance of the body.\nOther learned philosophers, such as those of the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 school of thought, declare that prescribed Vedic activities should never be given up. They contend that wherever there are two contradictory injunctions of the Vedas, if a specific one is more prominent, it annuls the general one. For example, the Vedas instruct us: m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni [v1] \u201cDo not commit violence toward any living entity.\u201d This is a general instruction. The same Vedas also instruct us to perform fire sacrifice. This is a specific instruction. It is possible that in performing a fire sacrifice some creatures may get killed in the fire unintentionally. But the M\u012bm\u0101nsakas (followers of the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 philosophy) contend that the specific instruction for performing the sacrifice prevails, and it must be followed even though it conflicts with the general instruction for not committing violence. Therefore, the Mim\u0101nsakas say we must never give up beneficial activities, such as sacrifice, charity, and penance.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The S\u0101nkhya philosophers advocate the cessation of all actions, except those for the sustenance of the body, as they believe desires lead to further transmigration. However, the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 philosophers argue that prescribed Vedic activities should never be abandoned. They assert that specific instructions, such as performing fire sacrifices, should take precedence over general instructions, like not committing violence. The M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 school believes in the importance of beneficial activities such as sacrifice, charity, and penance, even if they unintentionally result in harm to living beings. Both schools present different perspectives on the relationship between desire, actions, and the pursuit of spiritual liberation. The S\u0101nkhya philosophers emphasize renunciation, while the M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 philosophers prioritize the performance of Vedic rituals without disregarding their consequences."
