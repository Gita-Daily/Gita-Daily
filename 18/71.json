    "commentary": "\nNot everyone has the intellect to comprehend the deep imports of the dialogue between Shree Krishna and Arjun. Here, Shree Krishna reassures that if such people merely hear with faith, they will also benefit. God is seated within them; he will note their sincere endeavor and reward them for it. A story about a disciple of Jagadguru Shankaracharya, called Sananda, illustrates this point. He was illiterate and could not comprehend his Guru\u2019s teaching as the other disciples could. But when Shankaracharya delivered the discourse, he would listen with rapt attention and great faith. One day, he was washing his Guru\u2019s clothes on the other side of the river. It became time for the class, and the other disciples requested, \u201cGuruji, please begin the class.\u201d Shankaracharya replied, \u201cLet us wait; Sananda is not here.\u201d \u201cBut Guruji, he cannot understand anything,\u201d the disciples urged. \u201cThat is true; still, he listens with great faith and so I do not wish to disappoint him,\u201d said Shankaracharya.Then, to show the power of faith, Shankaracharya called out, \u201cSananda! Please come here.\u201d On hearing his Guru\u2019s words, Sananda did not hesitate. He ran on water. The story goes that wherever he placed his feet, lotus flowers sprang up to support him. He crossed over to the other bank and offered obeisance to his Guru. At that time, a stuti (verses in praise) of the Guru emanated from his mouth in sophisticated Sanskrit. The other disciples were amazed to hear this. Since, lotus flowers had bloomed under his feet, his name became \u201cPadmapada,\u201d meaning \u201cthe one with lotus flowers under the feet.\u201d He became one of the four main disciples of Shankaracharya, along with Sureshwaracharya, Hastamalak, and Trotakacharya. In the above verse, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that even those who merely hear the sacred dialogue with great faith will gradually become purified.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Not everyone can fully understand the deep conversation between Shree Krishna and Arjun in the Bhagavad Gita. However, Shree Krishna reassures that even those who simply listen with faith will benefit. This is illustrated by the story of Sananda, a disciple of Jagadguru Shankaracharya, who had great faith but was illiterate. Despite not being able to comprehend the teachings, Sananda would attentively listen to his Guru. One day, Shankaracharya called for Sananda, and to everyone's surprise, he ran on water with lotus flowers blooming under his feet. This display of faith impressed Shankaracharya, and Sananda became one of his main disciples. The story emphasizes the power of faith and how even those who only listen with faith will gradually be purified, as Krishna assures Arjun in the verse."
