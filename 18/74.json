He refers to Arjun as mah\u0101tm\u0101 (great soul), as he has heeded the advice and instructions of Shree Krishna, and hence has become eminently wise. Sanjay now remarks how amazed and astounded he is on hearing their divine dialogue. The hair standing on end is one of the symptoms of deep devotional fervor.

He reveals this in the next verse.\n", "next shlok": 75}
