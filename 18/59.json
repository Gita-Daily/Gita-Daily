We should not think we have complete liberty to do what we wish. The soul does not lead an independent existence; it is dependent upon God\u2019s creation in many ways. In the materially bound state, it is under the influence of the three gu\u1e47as. The combination of gu\u1e47as creates our nature, and according to its dictates, we are compelled to act. Hence, we do not have absolute freedom to say, \u201cI will do what I like.\u201d We have to choose between the good advice of God and the scriptures or the compulsions of our nature. There is an anecdote regarding one\u2019s nature. A soldier retired after thirty years of service and returned to his hometown. One day, he was standing in the coffee shop drinking a cup of tea, when a friend thought of a practical joke. He screamed from behind, \u201cAttention!\u201d Responding to that command had become a part of the soldier\u2019s nature. Involuntarily, he dropped the cup from his hand and put his hands by his side. Shree Krishna warns Arjun that by nature he is a warrior, and if, out of pride, he decides not to listen to good advice, his Kshatriya nature will still compel him to fight.\n", "next shlok": 60}
