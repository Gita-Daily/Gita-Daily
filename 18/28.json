Their mind is blotted with negative obsessions and thus they are ayukta\u1e25 (undisciplined). The scriptures give injunctions regarding what is proper and improper behavior. But workers in the mode of ignorance are stabdha\u1e25 (obstinate in their views), for they have closed their ears and mind to reason. Thus, they are often \u015bha\u1e6dha\u1e25 (cunning) and nai\u1e63hk\u1e5bitika\u1e25 (dishonest or vile) in their ways. They are pr\u0101k\u1e5bita\u1e25 (vulgar) because they do not believe in controlling their animal instinct. Though they may have duties to perform, they see effort as laborious and painful, and so they are alasa\u1e25 (slothful) and d\u012brgha-s\u016btr\u012b (procrastinating). Their ignoble and base thoughts impact them more than anyone else, making them vi\u1e63h\u0101d\u012b (unhappy and morose).The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam also describes types of performers of actions:s\u0101ttvika\u1e25 k\u0101rako \u2019sa\u1e45g\u012b r\u0101g\u0101ndho r\u0101jasa\u1e25 sm\u1e5bita\u1e25t\u0101masa\u1e25 sm\u1e5biti-vibhra\u1e63h\u1e6do nirgu\u1e47o mad-ap\u0101\u015bhraya\u1e25 (11.25.26)[v20]\u201cThe worker who is detached is s\u0101ttvic in nature; the one who is excessively attached to action and its results is r\u0101jasic; one who is devoid of discrimination is t\u0101masic.
