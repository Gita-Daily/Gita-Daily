Here, Sanjay acknowledges it was by his Guru\u2019s mercy that he got the opportunity to hear the supreme science of Yog from the Lord of Yog himself, Shree Krishna.Ved Vyas, the author of the Brahma S\u016btras, the Pura\u1e47as, the Mahabharat, etc. was a descension of God, and possessed all the clairvoyant powers himself. Thus, he not only heard the conversation between Shree Krishna and Arjun, but also the one between Sanjay and Dhritarasthra. Thereby, he included both conversations while compiling the Bhagavad Gita.\n", "next shlok": 76}
