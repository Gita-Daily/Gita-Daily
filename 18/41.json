But how do we discover the perfect profession for ourselves? Here, Shree Krishna explains that people have different natures, according to the gu\u1e47as that constitute their personality, and thus different professional duties are suitable for them. The system of var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram dharma was a scientific organization of society according to svabh\u0101va-prabhavair gu\u1e47ai\u1e25 (work based on one\u2019s nature and gu\u1e47as). In this system of categorization, there were four \u0101\u015bhrams (stages in life) and four var\u1e47as (occupational categories). The stages in life were: 1) Brahmacharya \u0101\u015bhram (student life), which lasted from birth till the age of 25. 2) G\u1e5bihastha \u0101\u015bhram (household life), which was regular married life, from the age of 25 till 50. 3) V\u0101naprastha \u0101\u015bhram (semi-renounced life), which was from the age of 50 till 75. In this stage, one continued to live with the family but practiced renunciation. 4) Sany\u0101s \u0101\u015bhram (renounced order), which was from the age of 75 onward, where one gave up all household duties and resided in a holy place, absorbing the mind in God.\nThe four var\u1e47as (occupational categories) were Brahmin (priestly class), Kshatriya (warrior and administrative class), Vaishya (mercantile and farming class), and Shudra (worker class). The var\u1e47as were not considered higher or lower amongst themselves. Since the center of society was God, everyone worked according to their intrinsic qualities to sustain themselves and society, and make their life a success by progressing toward God-realization. Thus, in the var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system, there was unity in diversity. Diversity is inherent in nature and can never be removed. We have various limbs in our body, and they all perform different functions. Expecting all limbs to perform the same functions is futile. Seeing them all as different is not a sign of ignorance, but factual knowledge of their utilities. Similarly, the variety amidst human beings cannot be ignored. Even in communist countries where equality is the foremost principle, there are party leaders who formulate ideologies; there is the military that wields guns and protects the nation; there are farmers who cultivate the land; and there are industrial workers who do mechanical jobs. The four classes of occupations exist there as well, despite all attempts to equalize. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system recognized the diversity in human natures and scientifically prescribed duties and occupations matching people\u2019s natures.\nHowever, with the passage of time the var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system deteriorated, and the basis of the var\u1e47as changed from one\u2019s nature to one\u2019s birth. The children of Brahmins started calling themselves as Brahmins, irrespective of whether they possessed the corresponding qualities or not. Also, the concept of upper and lower castes got propagated and the upper castes began looking down upon the lower castes. When the system grew rigid and birth-based, it became dysfunctional. This was a social defect that crept in with time, and was not the original intention of the Var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system. In the next few verses, according to the original categorization of the system, Shree Krishna maps the gu\u1e47as of people with their natural qualities of work.\n", "next shlok": 42}
