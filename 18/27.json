While the s\u0101ttvic workers are motivated by the desire for spiritual growth, the r\u0101jasic workers are deeply ambitious for materialistic enhancement.

Agitated with immoderate r\u0101g (desires of the mind and senses), they do not possess the purity of intention. They are convinced that the pleasure they seek is available in the things of the world. Hence, never satisfied by what comes their way, they are lubdha\u1e25 (greedy for more). When they see others succeeding or enjoying more than them, they become hins\u0101tmaka\u1e25 (enviously bent on injury). To fulfill their ends, they sometimes sacrifice morality, and hence become a\u015bhuchi\u1e25 (impure).
