King Janak had asked his Guru, \u201cThe transcendental knowledge you have bestowed upon me is so precious that I feel deeply indebted to you. What can I give you in return?\u201d Guru Ashtavakra replied, \u201cThere is nothing you can give that will relinquish you from your debt. The knowledge I gave was divine and all that you possess is material. Worldly objects can never be a price for divine knowledge. But you can do one thing. If ever you find someone who is thirsty for this knowledge, share it with him.\u201d Shree Krishna states here that he considers the sharing of the knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita as the highest loving service one can render to God. However, those who lecture on the Bhagavad Gita should not feel they are doing something very great. The proper attitude of the teacher is to see oneself as an instrument in the hands of God, and to accord all credit to the grace of the Lord.\n", "next shlok": 70}
