He thus wanted Arjun not to give up his Kshatriya dharma, but to do devotion alongside with it. This is the principle of karm yog. Now, Shree Krishna reverses this teaching by saying that here is no need to fulfill even material dharma. Arjun can renounce all material duties and simply surrender to God. This is the principle of karm sany\u0101s. Here, one may question that if we give up all our material dharmas will we not incur sin? Shree Krishna tells Arjun not to fear; he will absolve him from all sins, and liberate him from material existence.To comprehend this instruction of Shree Krishna, we need to understand the term dharma. It comes from the root word dh\u1e5bi, which means dh\u0101ra\u1e47 karane yogya, or \u201cresponsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.\u201d There are actually two kinds of dharmas\u2014material dharma and spiritual dharma. These two kinds of dharma are based upon two different understandings of the \u201cself.\u201d When we identify ourselves as the body, then our dharma is determined in accordance with our bodily designations, obligations, duties, and norms. Hence, serving the bodily parents, fulfilling the responsibilities to society, nation, etc. are all bodily dharma. This is also called apara dharma or material dharma. This includes the dharma as a Brahmin, Kshatriya, etc. However, when we identify ourselves as the soul, we have no material designations of var\u1e47a (social class) and \u0101\u015bhram (status in life). The soul\u2019s Father, Mother, Friend, Beloved, and resting place are all God. Hence our one and only dharma becomes loving devotional service to God. This is also called para dharma or spiritual dharma.If one leaves the material dharma it is considered a sin due to dereliction of duty. But if one leaves material dharma and takes the shelter of spiritual dharma, it is not a sin. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:devar\u1e63hi-bh\u016bt\u0101pta-n\u1e5bi\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 pit\u1e5d\u012b\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 na ki\u1e45karo n\u0101yam \u1e5bi\u1e47\u012b cha r\u0101jansarv\u0101tman\u0101 ya\u1e25 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 \u015bhara\u1e47ya\u1e41 gato mukunda\u1e41 parih\u1e5bitya kartam (11.5.41)[v37]This verse explains that for those who do not surrender to God, there are five debts\u2014to the celestial gods, to the sages, to the ancestors, to other humans, and to other living beings. The var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram system includes various procedures for releasing ourselves from these five kinds of debts. However, when we surrender to God, we are automatically released from all these debts, just as by watering the roots of a tree, all its branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, and fruit automatically get watered. Similarly, by fulfilling our duty to God, we automatically fulfill our duty to everyone. Hence, there is no sin in renouncing material dharma if we are properly situated in spiritual dharma. In fact, the ultimate goal is to engage completely and wholeheartedly in spiritual dharma. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:\u0101j\u00f1\u0101yaiva\u1e41 gu\u1e47\u0101n do\u1e63h\u0101n may\u0101di\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101n api svak\u0101ndharm\u0101n santyajya ya\u1e25 sarv\u0101n m\u0101\u1e41 bhajeta sa tu sattama\u1e25 (11.11.32) [v38]\u201cI have given innumerable instructions regarding the performance of bodily dharma in the Vedas. But those who realize the shortcomings in these, and renounce all prescribed duties, to simply engage in my devotional service, I consider them to be the best s\u0101dhaks.\u201d In the Ramayan, we read how Lakshman renounced all material duties to accompany Lord Ram in the forest. He said:guru pitu m\u0101tu na j\u0101nahu k\u0101h\u016b, kahahu subh\u0101\u016b n\u0101tha patiy\u0101\u016bmore sabahi\u00f1 eka tumha sw\u0101m\u012b, dinabhandhu ura antarayam\u012b [v39]\u201cO Lord, please believe me, I do not know any teacher, father, mother, etc. As far as I am concerned, you, the savior of the fallen and the knower of the heart, are my Master and my everything.\u201d Similarly, Prahlad said:m\u0101t\u0101 n\u0101sti pit\u0101 na \u2019sti na \u2019sti me swajano jana\u1e25 [v40]\u201cI do not know any mother, father, or relative (God is everything to me).\u201dIn the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna gave Arjun sequentially higher instructions. Initially, he instructed Arjun to do karm, i.e. his material dharma as a warrior (verse 2.31). But material dharma does not result in God-realization; it leads to the celestial abodes, and once the pious merits are depleted one has to come back. Hence, Shree Krishna next instructed Arjun to do karm yog, i.e. his material dharma with the body and spiritual dharma with the mind. He asked Arjun to fight the war with the body and remember God with the mind (verse 8.7). This instruction of karm yog forms the major portion of the Bhagavad Gita. Now in the very end, Shree Krishna instructs Arjun to practice karm sany\u0101s, i.e. renounce all material dharma and simply adopt spiritual dharma, which is love for God. He should thus fight, not because it is his duty as a warrior, but because God wants him to do so.But why did Shree Krishna not give this instruction to Arjun earlier? Why did he seem to clearly extol just the reverse in verse 5.2 when he stated karm yog superior as to karm sany\u0101s? Lord Krishna clearly explains this in the next verse.\n", "next shlok": 67}
