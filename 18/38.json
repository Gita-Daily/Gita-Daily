Even in the material realm, for meaningful accomplishment, it is necessary to reject r\u0101jasic happiness. As a reminder to steer him away from immediate but misleading joys, India\u2019s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, used to keep these lines from the poem, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening, on his desk:\nThe woods are lovely, dark, and deep,\nBut I have promises to keep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep,\nAnd miles to go before I sleep.\nThe path to lasting and divine bliss lies not in indulgence, but in renunciation, austerities, and discipline.\n", "next shlok": 39}
