Then he described the factors that motivate and control action. Now, he moves on to the goal of action. The ultimate motive behind people\u2019s actions is the search for happiness. Everyone desires to be happy, and through their actions they seek fulfillment, peace, and satisfaction. But since everyone\u2019s actions differ in their constituent factors, the kind of happiness they derive out of their work is also different. Shree Krishna now goes on to explain the three categories of happiness.\n", "next shlok": 37}
