    "commentary": "\nIn the previous verses, Shree Krishna discussed the constituents of action. Then he described the factors that motivate and control action. Now, he moves on to the goal of action. The ultimate motive behind people’s actions is the search for happiness. Everyone desires to be happy, and through their actions they seek fulfillment, peace, and satisfaction. But since everyone’s actions differ in their constituent factors, the kind of happiness they derive out of their work is also different. Shree Krishna now goes on to explain the three categories of happiness.\n",
