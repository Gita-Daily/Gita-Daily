S\u0101ttvic doers are mukta sanga\u1e25, i.e. they do not try to cling to things in worldly attachment, nor do they believe that worldly things can bestow satisfaction to the soul. Hence, they work with noble motives. And since their intentions are pure, they are filled with uts\u0101ha (zeal) and dh\u1e5biti (strong resolve) in their endeavors. Their mental attitude results in the least dissipation of energies while working. Thus, they are able to work tirelessly to fulfill their sublime motives. Though they may accomplish great things, they are anaham v\u0101d\u012b (free from egotism), and they give all credit for their successes to God.\n",
