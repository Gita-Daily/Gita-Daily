    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna stated in the previous verse that on becoming situated in transcendental knowledge one develops devotion. Now he says that only through devotion can one come to know God\u2019s personality. Previously, the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b had realized God as the nirgu\u1e47a (quality-less), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63ha (attribute-less), nir\u0101k\u0101r (formless) Brahman. But the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b had no realization of the personal form of God. The secret of that personal form cannot be known through karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog, etc. It is love that opens the door to the impossible and makes way for the inaccessible. Shree Krishna states here that the mystery of God\u2019s form, virtues, pastimes, abode, and associates can only be comprehended through unalloyed devotion. The devotees understand God because they possess the eyes of love.The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 mentions a beautiful incident illustrating the above truth. A \u1e5bi\u1e63hi by the name of Jabali saw a very effulgent and peaceful maiden meditating in the forest. He requested her to reveal her identity and purpose of meditation. She replied:brahmavidy\u0101hamatul\u0101 yogi\u1e41drairy\u0101 cha m\u1e5bigyates\u0101ha\u1e41 hari pad\u0101mbhoja k\u0101myay\u0101 suchira\u1e41 tapa\u1e25char\u0101myasmin vane ghore dhy\u0101yant\u012b puru\u1e63hottamambrahm\u0101nandena p\u016br\u1e47\u0101ha\u1e41 ten\u0101nandena t\u1e5biptadh\u012b\u1e25tath\u0101pi \u015bh\u016bnyam\u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 manye k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47arati\u1e41 vin\u0101 [v29]\u201cI am Brahma Vidy\u0101 (the science of knowing the self, which ultimately leads to the Brahman realization of God). Great yogis and mystics perform austerities to know me. However, I am myself performing severe austerities to develop love at the lotus feet of the personal form of God. I am replete and satiated with the bliss of Brahman. Yet, without loving attachment to Lord Krishna, I feel empty and void.\u201d Thus, mere knowledge is insufficient for relishing the bliss of the personal form of God. It is through bhakti that one enters into this secret and achieves full God-consciousness.\n",

An incident from the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 illustrates this truth, where a maiden performs severe austerities to develop love for the personal form of God, despite being replete with the bliss of Brahman.
