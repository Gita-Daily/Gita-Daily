    "commentary": "\nIt was explained in the previous verse that if one is situated in loving devotion to God, there is no sin in giving up the material duties. However, there is one problem with this instruction. If we have not yet become established in love for God, and we prematurely give up material duties, we will be neither here nor there. Thus, karm sany\u0101s is only for those who are qualified for it. And what we are qualified for has to be determined by our Guru, who knows our capabilities and the stringency of the paths. If a student wishes to become a graduate, it will not do to directly go and attend the graduation ceremony. We will have to begin studies sequentially from grade one. Similarly, the vast majority of people are eligible for karm yog, and it would be a great folly for them to prematurely take karm sany\u0101s. It is better to instruct them to fulfill their bodily dharma and practice devotion alongside. That is why, in this verse Shree Krishna says that this confidential teaching given by him is not for everyone. Before sharing it with others, we should check their eligibility for this teaching.This word of caution applies specifically for the confidential teachings of the previous verse, and in general, for the entire message of the Bhagavad Gita. If it is explained to someone who is envious of Shree Krishna, that person may respond, \u201cShree Krishna was very conceited. He kept asking Arjun to glorify him.\u201d By misunderstanding the teachings, the faithless listener will be harmed by the divine message. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 also states:a\u015bhraddadh\u0101ne vimukhe \u2019py a\u015bh\u1e5bi\u1e47vati ya\u015bh chopade\u015bha\u1e25 \u015bhiva-n\u0101m\u0101par\u0101dha\u1e25 [v41]\u201cBy giving transcendental instructions to those who are faithless and averse to God, we cause them to become offenders.\u201d Hence, Shree Krishna describes the disqualifications for listeners in the above verse.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary explains that while it is acceptable to give up material duties if one is immersed in loving devotion to God, prematurely abandoning these duties without being established in love can be problematic. Karma sanyas is only suitable for those who are qualified, and the Guru determines our eligibility. Most people are eligible for karma yoga and should not prematurely take up renunciation. They should fulfill their worldly duties while practicing devotion. The confidential teachings of Shree Krishna are not for everyone, and caution must be exercised while sharing them. Misunderstanding or teaching them to those envious of Shree Krishna can harm the listener. Giving transcendental instructions to those without faith or devotion can lead them to become offenders. Shree Krishna lists the disqualifications for listeners."
