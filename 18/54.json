The words Brahma-bh\u016bta\u1e25 mean the state of Brahman realization. Situated in it, one is prasann\u0101tm\u0101, meaning serene and unaffected by turbid and painful experiences. Na \u015bhochati means one does not grieve nor feel any incompleteness. Na k\u0101\u1e45k\u1e63hati means one does not crave for any material thing to make one\u2019s happiness complete. Such a yogi sees all living beings with equal vision, realizing the substratum of Brahman in all of them. In such a state, one is situated on the platform of realized knowledge. However, Shree Krishna concludes the verse with a twist. He says that in such a realized state of knowledge, one then attains par\u0101 bhakti (divine love) for God.The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs are often fond of saying that bhakti is only to be done as an intermediate step toward Brahman realization. They claim that bhakti is for the purpose of purifying the heart, and at the end of the journey, only j\u00f1\u0101na remains. Thus, they recommend that those who possess a strong intellect can ignore devotion and simply cultivate knowledge. But the above verse negates such a viewpoint. Shree Krishna states that having attained the highest realization of j\u00f1\u0101na, one develops par\u0101 bhakti. Ved Vyas has declared the same in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam:\u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m\u0101\u015bh cha munayo nirgranth\u0101 apy urukramekurvanty ahaituk\u012b\u1e41 bhaktim ittham-bh\u016bta-gu\u1e47o hari\u1e25 (1.7.10)[v24]\u201cEven those who are \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m (rejoicing in the self), established in self-knowledge, and liberated from material bonds, such perfected souls desire to possess bhakti toward God. The super-excellent qualities of God are such that they attract even the liberated souls.\u201d There are many examples of renowned j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who had attained self-knowledge and were situated in the realization of the formless Brahman. However, when they got a glimpse of the transcendental divine qualities of God, they naturally got drawn toward bhakti. Instances of such j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs from each of the four yugas are given here.The greatest j\u00f1an\u012bs in Satya Yuga were the four sons of Brahma\u2014Sanat Kumar, Sanatan Kumar, Sanak Kumar, and Sanandan Kumar. They were self-realized from birth, and their minds were always absorbed in the formless Brahman. These four brothers once visited Vaikunth, the divine abode of Lord Vishnu. There, the fragrance from the tuls\u012b (holy basil) leaves at the lotus feet of the Lord entered their nostrils, causing a thrill of ecstasy in their hearts. Immediately, their meditation on the attributeless Brahman ended, and they were immersed in the bliss of divine love for Lord Vishnu. They beseeched him for a boon:k\u0101ma\u1e41 bhava\u1e25 sva-v\u1e5bijinair niraye\u1e63hu na\u1e25 st\u0101chcheto \u2019livad yadi nu te padayo rameta\u00a0(Bh\u0101gavatam 3.15.49)[v25]\u201cO Lord, we do not even mind if you send us to hell, so long as our mind gets the opportunity to drink the divine love bliss that emanates from your lotus feet.\u201d Just imagine, even after having realized the formless Brahman, these foremost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs were willing to reside in hell for the sake of relishing the bliss of the personal form of God.Let us now move on to Tret\u0101 Yuga. The topmost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b in this age was King Janak. He was the father of Sita, the eternal consort of Lord Ram. He was also known as Videha, one who was beyond all perceptions of the body. His mind would remain ever absorbed in the formless Brahman. One day, however, Sage Vishwamitra came to meet him, along with Lord Ram and Lakshman. What took place then is described in the Ramayan:inhani bilokata ati anur\u0101g\u0101, barabasa brahmasukhahi mana ty\u0101g\u0101 [v26]\u201cOn seeing Lord Ram, King Janak became detached from the bliss of the formless Brahman, and deeply attached to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.\u201d In this manner, the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of the age of Tret\u0101 came to the path of bhakti.\u201dThe topmost j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b in the age of Dw\u0101par was Shukadev, the son of Sage Ved Vyas. The Puranas describe him as being so elevated that he remained in his mother\u2019s womb for twelve years, thinking that if he came into the world, the material energy, Maya, would overpower him. Finally, Sage Narad came and spoke to him through his mother\u2019s ear, reassuring him that nothing would happen and he should emerge from the womb. Finally, he emerged, and by his yogic power, he expanded his body to that of a twelve-year old and renounced home to live in the forest. There, he soon reached the highest state of sam\u0101dhi. Years went by, and one day Ved Vyas\u2019s students were cutting wood in the forest, when they saw him in sam\u0101dhi. They went back and told the Sage about it. He told them to recite a verse in Shukadev\u2019s ears, describing the beauty of the personal form of Lord Krishna:barh\u0101p\u012b\u1e0da\u1e41 na\u1e6da-vara-vapu\u1e25 kar\u1e47ayo\u1e25 kar\u1e47ik\u0101ra\u1e41bibhrad v\u0101sa\u1e25 kanaka-kapi\u015bha\u1e41 vaijayant\u012b\u1e41 cha m\u0101l\u0101mrandhr\u0101n ve\u1e47or adhara-sudhay\u0101p\u016brayan gopa-v\u1e5bindairv\u1e5bind\u0101ra\u1e47ya\u1e41 sva-pada-rama\u1e47a\u1e41 pr\u0101vi\u015bhad g\u012bta-k\u012brti\u1e25(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.21.5)[v27]\u201cShree Krishna is adorned with a peacock feathered crown upon his head, and exhibits his form as the greatest dancer. His ears are decorated with blue kar\u1e47ik\u0101 flowers. His shawl is the color of brilliant gold. He wears a garland made of vaijayant\u012b beads. He fills the holes of his flute with the nectar from his lips. His praises are sung as he enters Vrindavan, surrounded by his cowherd friends, and the marks of his footprints beautify the earth.\u201d Shukadev was absorbed in the formless Brahman when the verse entered his ears. Suddenly, the object of his meditation transformed into the enchanting form of Lord Krishna. He felt so deeply attracted to the bliss of the personal form of God, that he left his sam\u0101dhi and went back to his father, Ved Vyas. From him, he heard the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, which is full of the sweetness of bhakti. Later, on the banks of the Ganges, he related it to King Parikshit, grandson of Arjun. In this manner, the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of the age of Dw\u0101par got drawn to the path of bhakti.Finally, we come to Kali Yuga. Jagadguru Shankaracharya is widely considered the greatest j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b of this age. He is widely acclaimed as the propagator of advaita v\u0101da (non-dualism), in which he stated that there is only one entity in existence, which is the nirgu\u1e47a (without qualities), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63ha (attributeless), nir\u0101k\u0101r (formless) Brahman. However, many people are unaware that from the age of twenty until he left his body at the age of thirty-two, he wrote hundreds of verses in praise of Lord Krishna, Lord Ram, Lord Shiv, Mother Durga, etc. He also visited the four dh\u0101ms (centers of spirituality in the four corners of India), and worshipped deities of the personal forms of God in all of them. In Prabodh Sudh\u0101kar, he writes:k\u0101myop\u0101sanay\u0101rthayantyanudina\u1e41 ki\u00f1chitphala\u1e41 swepsitamkechit swargamath\u0101pavargamapare yog\u0101diyaj\u00f1\u0101dibhi\u1e25asm\u0101ka\u1e41 yadunandan\u0101\u1e45ghriyugaladhy\u0101n\u0101vadh\u0101n\u0101rthin\u0101mki\u1e41 lokena damena ki\u1e41 n\u1e5bipatin\u0101 swarg\u0101pavargai\u015bhcha kim\u00a0(verse 250)[v28]\u201cThose who perform righteous actions for the attainment of celestial abodes may do so. Those who desire liberation via the path of j\u00f1\u0101na or a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yog may pursue that goal. As for me, I want nothing of these two paths. I wish only to engross myself in the nectar of Shree Krishna\u2019s lotus feet. I do not desire either worldly or heavenly pleasures, nor do I desire liberation. I am a rasik who relishes the bliss of divine love.\u201d The fact is that Shankaracharya was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. What he taught in his bh\u0101\u1e63hyas (commentaries) was the need of the times. When he appeared upon the earth, Buddhism was prevailing all over India. In such an environment, to reestablish the faith of the Buddhists in the Vedas, he sidelined devotion while writing his bh\u0101\u1e63hyas. But later, in the numerous stutis (praises) he wrote for the personal forms of God, he revealed his inner devotion. Shankaracharya was thus an example in the age of Kali, of someone who had reached the highest realization of j\u00f1\u0101na, and who then did devotion.\n", "next shlok": 55}
