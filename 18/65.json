    "commentary": "\nIn chapter 9, Shree Krishna had promised Arjun to reveal to him the most secret knowledge, and then gone on to describe the glories of bhakti. Here, he repeats the first line of verse 9.34, asking him to engage in his devotion. By developing deep love for Shree Krishna and having his mind always absorbed in exclusive devotion to him, Arjun will be assured of attaining the supreme destination. The perfect example of someone completely absorbed in devotion was King Ambarish. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam describes:sa vai mana\u1e25 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-pad\u0101ravindayor vach\u0101\u1e41si vaiku\u1e47\u1e6dha-gu\u1e47\u0101nuvar\u1e47anekarau harer mandira-m\u0101rjan\u0101di\u1e63hu \u015bhruti\u1e41 chak\u0101r\u0101chyuta-sat-kathodayemukunda-li\u1e45g\u0101laya-dar\u015bhane d\u1e5bi\u015bhau tad-bh\u1e5bitya-g\u0101tra-spar\u015bhe \u2019\u1e45ga-sa\u1e45gamamghr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 cha tat-p\u0101da-saroja-saurabhe \u015bhr\u012bmat-tulasy\u0101 rasan\u0101\u1e41 tad-arpitep\u0101dau hare\u1e25 k\u1e63hetra-pad\u0101nusarpa\u1e47e \u015bhiro h\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u012bke\u015bha-pad\u0101bhivandanek\u0101ma\u1e41 cha d\u0101sye na tu k\u0101ma-k\u0101myay\u0101 yathottama\u015bhloka-jan\u0101\u015bhray\u0101 rati\u1e25(9.4.18-20) [v36]\u201cAmbarish absorbed his mind on the lotus feet of Shree Krishna; he used his speech in glorifying the qualities of God, his hands in cleaning the temple, and his ears in hearing the divine pastimes of the Lord. He engaged his eyes in seeing the deities; he used his limbs in touching the bodies of the devotees, his nose in smelling the fragrance of the Tuls\u012b (holy basil) leaves offered at the feet of the Lord, and his tongue in tasting pras\u0101d (food sanctified by offering to God). He utilized his feet for walking to the holy abodes, and his head in offering obeisance to the lotus feet of God. He offered all paraphernalia, such as garlands and sandalwood, in the service of God. He did all this, not with some selfish motive, but only to attain the selfless service of Lord Krishna, through purification.\u201dThe instruction to wholeheartedly engage in devotion is the essence of all the scriptures, and the summum bonum of all knowledge. However, this is not the most confidential knowledge that Shree Krishna referred to, for he has already mentioned this earlier. He now reveals this supreme secret in this next verse.\n",

By being absorbed in exclusive devotion and having his mind always focused on Shree Krishna, Arjun will attain the supreme destination. The example of King Ambarish is given, who engaged all his senses in the service of God without any selfish motive. Wholehearted engagement in devotion is the essence of all scriptures and the ultimate knowledge. However, this is not the most confidential knowledge. Shree Krishna promised to reveal the most secret knowledge to Arjun, which he now unveils in the next verse."
