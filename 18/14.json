Kart\u0101 means \u201cthe doer,\u201d and refers to the soul. Although the soul itself does not perform actions, it inspires the body-mind-intellect mechanism with the life force to act. Further, it identifies with their actions, due to the influence of the ego. Therefore, it is responsible for the actions performed by the body, and it is called both the knower and the doer. The Pra\u015bhna Upani\u1e63had states: e\u1e63ha hi dra\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101 spra\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101 \u015bhrot\u0101 ghr\u0101t\u0101 rasayit\u0101 mant\u0101 boddh\u0101 kart\u0101 vij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101tm\u0101 puru\u1e63ha\u1e25 sa pare \u2019k\u1e63hara \u0101tmani sa\u1e41prati\u1e63h\u1e6dhate (4.9)[v3] \u201cIt is the soul that sees, touches, hears, feels, tastes, thinks, and comprehends. Thus, the soul is to be considered both\u2014the knower and the doer of actions.\u201d The Brahma S\u016btra also states: j\u00f1o \u2018ta eva (2.3.18)[v4] \u201cIt is truly the soul that is the knower.\u201d Again, the Brahma S\u016btra states: kart\u0101 \u015bh\u0101str\u0101rthavattv\u0101t (2.3.33)[v5] \u201cThe soul is the doer of actions, and this is confirmed by the scriptures.\u201d From the above quotations, it is clear that the soul is also a factor in accomplishing actions.The senses are instruments used for performing actions. Without the senses, the soul could not have experienced the sensations of taste, touch, sight, smell, or sound. There are also the five working senses\u2014hands, legs, voice, genitals, and anus. It is with their help that the soul accomplishes various kinds of work. Thus, the senses are also listed as factors in accomplishing actions.Despite all the instruments of action, if one does not put in effort, nothing is ever done. In fact, effort is so important that Chanakya Pandit states in his Neeti S\u016btras: uts\u0101havat\u0101\u1e41 \u015bhatravopi va\u015bh\u012bbhavanti [v6] \u201cWith sufficient effort, even poor destiny can be transformed into good fortune.\u201d Nirutv\u0101h\u0101d daiva\u1e41 patita [v7] \u201cWithout proper effort, even good destiny can be converted into misfortune.\u201d Therefore, che\u1e63h\u1e6dh\u0101 (effort) is another ingredient of action.God is seated within the body of the living being as the witness. Based upon their past karmas, he also bestows different abilities to different people to perform actions. One may call this Divine Providence. For example, some people possess the acumen for earning huge amounts of wealth. Their acquaintances become astonished by their brilliant financial analysis of complex situations. They also seem to be lucky with the risks they take. This special intellect is granted to them by God. Similarly, others seem to have God-given talents in fields such as sports, music, art, literature, etc. It is God who bestows people these special abilities, in accordance with their past karmas. He also grants the results of the present karmas. Hence, he is listed as one of the factors responsible for action.\n", "next shlok": 15}
