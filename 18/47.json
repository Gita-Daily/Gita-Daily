    "commentary": "\nWhen we do our swa-dharma (prescribed occupational duties), there is a two-fold advantage. It is in tune with our disposition. Hence, it is as natural to our personality as flying is to a bird and swimming is to a fish. Secondly, since it is comfortable to the mind, it can almost be done involuntarily, and the consciousness becomes free to be engaged in devotion.\nInstead, if we abandon our duties thinking them to be defective, and take up another\u2019s duties unsuitable for our nature, we struggle against the innate inclination of our personality. This was exactly Arjun\u2019s situation. His Kshatriya nature was inclined to military and administrative activities. Events drove him to a situation where it was necessary to participate in a war of righteousness. If he were to shirk from his duty and withdraw from the battlefield to practice austerities in the forest, it would not help him spiritually, for even in the forest, he would not be able to get away from his inherent nature. In all likelihood, he would gather the tribal people in the jungle and become their king. Instead, it would be better for him to continue doing his duty born of his nature, and worship God by offering the fruits of his works to him.\nWhen one becomes spiritually accomplished the swa-dharma changes. It no longer remains at the bodily platform; it becomes the dharma of the soul, which is devotion to God. At that stage, one is justified in giving up occupational duties and engaging wholeheartedly in devotion because that is now the swa-dharma of one\u2019s nature. For people with that eligibility, Shree Krishna will give the final conclusion in the end of the Bhagavad Gita: \u201cGive up all varieties of dharmas and simply surrender unto me.\u201d (18.66) However, until that stage is reached, the instruction given in this verse applies. Thus, the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:\nt\u0101vat karm\u0101\u1e47i kurv\u012bta na nirvidyeta y\u0101vat\u0101\nmat-kath\u0101-\u015bhrava\u1e47\u0101dau v\u0101 \u015bhraddh\u0101 y\u0101van na j\u0101yate (11.20.9)[v23]\n\u201cWe must keep doing our prescribed occupational duties as long as the taste for devotion through hearing, chanting, and meditating on the leelas of God has not developed.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains the importance of following one's prescribed occupational duties, known as swa-dharma. By adhering to these duties, which are in alignment with our natural disposition, we can engage in them effortlessly and devote our consciousness to spiritual practices. When we abandon our duties and take up tasks unsuitable for our nature, we go against our innate inclinations and struggle. Arjuna, faced with the dilemma of participating in a righteous war, was advised to continue acting according to his Kshatriya nature rather than withdrawing. As one progresses spiritually, swa-dharma transcends the physical plane and becomes devotion to God. Those with this eligibility can give up occupational duties and surrender to God completely. Until then, it is essential to fulfill our prescribed duties while developing a taste for devotion to God through hearing, chanting, and meditating on His divine pastimes."
