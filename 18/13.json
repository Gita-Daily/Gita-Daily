Simultaneously, he clarifies that the description of the five limbs of action is not a new analysis, but what has previously been described in the S\u0101nkhya philosophy as well. S\u0101nkhya refers to the system of philosophy established by Maharishi Kapil, who was a descension of God and appeared on the earth as the child of Kardam Muni and Devahuti. The S\u0101nkhya philosophy he propounded is based upon a system of analytical rationality. It develops knowledge of the self through an analysis of the elements within the body and in the world. It also ascertains the nature of cause and effect by an analysis of the elements of action.\n",
