    "commentary": "\nThe Kshatriyas were those whose natures were predominantly rājasic, with a mixture of sattva guṇa. This made them royal, heroic, daring, commanding, and charitable. Their qualities were suitable for martial and leadership works, and they formed the administrative class that governed the country. Yet, they realized that they were not as learned and pure as the Brahmins. Hence, they respected the Brahmins and took advice from them on ideological, spiritual, and policy matters.\n",
