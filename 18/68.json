He says such preachers first attain his para bhakti, and then attain him.The opportunity to engage ourselves in devotion is a special blessing of God, but the opportunity to help others engage in devotion is an even bigger blessing, which attracts the special grace of God. Whenever we share something good with others, we benefit from it too. When we share whatever knowledge we have with others, by grace our own knowledge increases as well. By often giving food to others, we never go hungry ourselves. Saint Kabir said:d\u0101na diye dhana n\u0101 gha\u1e6de, nad\u012b ghate na n\u012braapane h\u0101tha dekha lo, yo\u1e45 ky\u0101 kahe kab\u012bra [v42]\u201cWealth does not decrease by giving in charity; a river does not become narrow, though people take water from it.

    "newest_commentary": "According to Shree Krishna, those who properly preach the message of the Bhagavad Gita attain his para bhakti and ultimately attain him. Sharing the knowledge of devotion with others is a special blessing from God and attracts his special grace. When we share something good with others, we also benefit from it. By sharing our knowledge, our own knowledge increases. Similarly, by giving food to others, we never go hungry ourselves. This is supported by the words of Saint Kabir who said that wealth does not decrease by giving in charity, just as a river does not become narrow when people take water from it. Therefore, sharing the spiritual knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita with others brings the greatest blessing."
