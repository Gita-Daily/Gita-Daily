    "newest_commentary": "The commentary describes how the intellects of those in tamo gu\u1e47a, the mode of ignorance, are clouded by ignorance, leading to a lack of concern for what is right and wrong. They prioritize their self-interest and ignore the consequences of their actions on themselves and others. This kind of action, termed as t\u0101masic, results in decay of health and vitality. It is considered wasteful and harmful. Examples of t\u0101masic actions include gambling, stealing, corruption, and excessive drinking."
