    "commentary": "\nHere, Shree Krishna pronounces his verdict that we should never renounce actions which elevate us and are beneficial for humankind. Such actions, if performed in the proper consciousness, do not bind us, instead they help us grow spiritually. Consider, for example, a caterpillar. In order to transform itself, it weaves a cocoon for its evolution and encages itself in it. Once it becomes a butterfly, it breaks open the cocoon and soars into the sky. Our position in the world is similar to this. Like the ugly caterpillar, we are presently attached to the world and bereft of noble qualities. As a part of our self-preparation and self-education, we need to perform actions that bring about the inner transformation we desire. Yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), d\u0101n (charity), and tapa (penance) are acts that help in our spiritual evolution and growth. At times, it may seem that they are binding too, but they are like the caterpillar\u2019s cocoon. They melt our impurities, beautify us from within, and effectually help us break through the shackles of earthly life. Hence, Shree Krishna instructs in this verse that such auspicious activities must never be abandoned. He now qualifies his statement by revealing the proper attitude with which they must be performed.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna emphasizes that we should not renounce actions that uplift us and benefit humanity. These actions, when performed with the right mindset, do not bind us but aid our spiritual growth. The analogy of a caterpillar transforming into a butterfly is used to explain our current state and the need for inner transformation. Yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), d\u0101n (charity), and tapa (penance) are mentioned as acts that facilitate our spiritual evolution. Although these actions may initially appear binding, they are like the caterpillar's cocoon, purging impurities and beautifying us internally. Shree Krishna advises against abandoning such auspicious activities. Additionally, he highlights the importance of the proper attitude while performing them.",
