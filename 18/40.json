It is the mother-like womb of the innumerable living beings within the universe. It is brought into existence and supported by the one unborn Lord, who is full of knowledge. God, however, does not consort with his material energy. He independently enjoys the pleasure of his transcendental pastimes. But the living entity enjoys her and thus becomes bound.\u201dMaya\u2019s domain extends from the nether regions to the celestial abode of Brahma. Since the three modes of nature\u2014sattva, rajas, and tamas\u2014are inherent attributes of Maya, they exist in all the material abodes of existence. Hence all living beings in these abodes, be they humans or the celestial gods, are under the sway of these three modes. The difference is only in the relative proportions of the three gu\u1e47as. The residents of the nether regions have a predominance of tamas; the residents of the earth planet have a predominance of rajas; and the residents of the celestial abodes have a predominance of sattva. Now, using these three variables, Shree Krishna explains why human beings possess differing natures.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had describes Maya, the material energy, as tri-colored, representing the three modes of goodness, passion, and ignorance. This energy is the source of creation for all living beings in the universe and is sustained by the unborn Lord. While God does not associate directly with Maya, the living entities are influenced by it and become bound by it. Maya's influence extends from the lower realms to the celestial abode of Brahma, and the three modes of nature exist in all material abodes. The difference lies in the proportions of these modes. The lower realms are dominated by ignorance, the earthly realm by passion, and the celestial abodes by goodness. These varying natures in human beings are attributed to the influence of these modes of nature."
