Those who perform virtuous actions are awarded the celestial realms; those who perform unrighteous actions are given birth in the nether realms; and those who perform a mixture of both come back to the human realm. But this applies only when the actions are performed with a desire for rewards. When such fruitive desire is renounced and work is done merely as a duty to God, then no such results accrue from actions.A similar rule exists in the world as well. If one person kills another it is considered murder, which is a crime that can even result in the death sentence. However, if the government declares that someone is a notorious murderer or thief who is wanted dead or alive, then killing such a person is not considered an offence in the eyes of the law. Instead, it is rewarded by the government, and the killer is even respected as a national hero. Similarly, when we give up personal motive in our actions, then the three-fold fruits of actions do not accrue.\n", "next shlok": 13}
