Thus, human beings do see him during his descension upon the earth, but they see only his material form. His divine form is not visible to their material eyes. That is the reason why souls in this material world cannot recognize God when he takes an Avat\u0101r on earth. Shree Krishna mentioned this in the ninth chapter, verse 11: \u201cWhen I descend in My personal form deluded persons are unable to recognize Me. They do not know the divinity of My personality, as the Supreme Lord of all beings.\u201d What people see is only the material form of the divine descension.The same theory applies to his cosmic form. In the previous two verses, Shree Krishna asked Arjun to see the cosmic form, but Arjun could see nothing because he had material eyes. The physical eyes are insufficient to see that universal form and the ordinary intellect is unequipped to comprehend it. Thus, Shree Krishna now says that he will grant the divine vision with which it will become possible to behold the universal form with all its majesty.The granting of spiritual vision is an act of grace by the Supreme Lord. By his grace, God adds his divine eyes to the soul\u2019s material eyes; he adds his divine mind to the soul\u2019s material mind; he adds his divine intellect to the soul\u2019s material intellect. Then, equipped with the divine senses, mind, and intellect of God, the soul can see his divine form, think of it, and comprehend it.\n", "next shlok": 9}
