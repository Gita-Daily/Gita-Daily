    "commentary": "\nMany of the generals on the side of the Kauravas were heretofore undefeated in combat. Jayadrath had the boon that whoever caused his head to fall on the ground would instantly have his own head burst into pieces. Karn had a special weapon called \u201c\u015ahakti\u201d given to him by Indra, which would slay anyone against whom it was used. But it could only be used once, and so Karn had kept it to take vengeance on Arjun. Dronacharya had received the knowledge of all weapons and how to neutralize them from Parshuram, who was an Avat\u0101r of God. Bheeshma had a boon that he would only die when he chose to do so. And yet, if God wished them to die in the battle, then nothing could save them. There is a saying:vindhya na \u012bndhana p\u0101iye, s\u0101gara ju\u1e0dai na n\u012braparai upas kuber ghara, jyo\u1e45 vipak\u1e63ha raghub\u012bra [v11]\u201cIf Lord Ram decides to be against you, then you may live in the Vindhyachal forest, but you will not be able to get firewood to light a fire; you may be by the side of the ocean, but water will be scarce for your usage; and you may live in the house of Kuber, the god of wealth, but you will not have enough to eat.\u201d Thus, even the biggest arrangements for security cannot avert a person\u2019s death if God has willed it to happen. Similarly, Shree Krishna says that he has already decided the outcome, but he wishes Arjun to be the medium to accomplish it and receive the glory of the conquest as a reward for his agency. Just as devotees wish to glorify God, it is God\u2019s nature to glorify his devotees. Hence, Shree Krishna does not wish the credit to come to him; he wishes people to say after the war, \u201cArjun fought so valiantly that he secured victory for the Pandavas.\u201dIn spiritual life too, aspirants often become discouraged when they find themselves incapable of removing the defects of anger, greed, envy, lust, pride, etc. Their Guru then encourages them, \u201cDo not be dejected. Fight and you will conquer the enemies of your mind because God wants you to succeed. Your effort will be instrumental, while God will fashion your victory by his grace.\u201dWhat was Arjun\u2019s reaction upon hearing the Lord\u2019s call to action? This is stated in the next verse.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary discusses the undefeated generals on the Kauravas' side, such as Jayadrath, Karn, Dronacharya, and Bheeshma, highlighting their special abilities and boons. It emphasizes that even these formidable warriors are not invincible if God has decided their fate. The saying 'vindhya na \u012bndhana p\u0101iye' illustrates that God's will cannot be overcome, regardless of one's preparations. Shree Krishna reveals that he has already determined the outcome of the battle but wants Arjun to be the instrument of its accomplishment. Just as devotees glorify God, God seeks to glorify his devotees. In spiritual life, devotees may feel discouraged by their inability to overcome their flaws. However, their Guru reassures them that with their effort and God's grace, victory over the enemies of the mind is certain. The commentary ends with the mention of Arjun's reaction to the Lord's call to action, which is discussed in the following verse."
