    "commentary": "\nBy special grace, Arjun has been shown the cosmic form that is not easily seen by anyone. Arjun has realized that Shree Krishna is much more than merely his friend. His divine personality encompasses unlimited universes. Yet, he is not attracted by the infinite opulences and is not interested in doing ai\u015bhwarya bhakti of God Almighty. Rather, he prefers seeing that Almighty Lord in the human form, so that he can relate to him as before, like a friend. Addressing Lord Krishna as sahasra-b\u0101ho, meaning \u201cthousand-armed one,\u201d Arjuna is now specifically requesting to see the chatur-bhuj r\u016bp, or four- armed form of Lord Krishna.In the four-armed form, Shree Krishna appeared before Arjun on another occasion as well. When Arjun tied Ashwatthama, the killer of the five sons of Draupadi and brought him before her, at that time Shree Krishna revealed himself in his four-armed form.ni\u015bhamya bh\u012bma-gadita\u1e41 draupady\u0101\u015bh cha chatur-bhuja\u1e25\u0101lokya vadana\u1e41 sakhyur idam \u0101ha hasanniva (\u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam 1.7.52)[v23]\u201cThe four-armed Shree Krishna heard the statements of Bheem, Draupadi, and others.

    "new_commentary": "Arjuna, having witnessed the cosmic form of Shree Krishna, recognizes Him as the divine personality encompassing unlimited universes. Rather than being attracted to the immense opulence, Arjuna desires to relate to Krishna as a friend and requests to see His four-armed form. This form had previously appeared when Krishna revealed Himself to Arjuna after capturing the killer of Draupadi's five sons. By addressing Him as sahasra-b\u0101ho and appealing to His four-armed form, Arjuna acknowledges the unity of Krishna's various manifestations. This commentary highlights Arjuna's deep understanding of the divine nature of Krishna and his unique relationship with Him.",
