Arjun has realized that Shree Krishna is much more than merely his friend. His divine personality encompasses unlimited universes. Yet, he is not attracted by the infinite opulences and is not interested in doing ai\u015bhwarya bhakti of God Almighty. Rather, he prefers seeing that Almighty Lord in the human form, so that he can relate to him as before, like a friend. Addressing Lord Krishna as sahasra-b\u0101ho, meaning \u201cthousand-armed one,\u201d Arjuna is now specifically requesting to see the chatur-bhuj r\u016bp, or four- armed form of Lord Krishna.In the four-armed form, Shree Krishna appeared before Arjun on another occasion as well.
