    "commentary": "\nArjun had referred to Shree Krishna as “Yogeshwar” in verse 11.4. Now, Sanjay refers to him as “Maha-Yogeshwar,” adding the superlative “great” to the address “Lord of all yogis.” Sanjay was bestowed with the gift of far-sighted vision by his Guru, Ved Vyas. So he also beheld the Lord’s cosmic form in the same manner as Arjun saw it. In the next four verses, Sanjay describes to Dhritarashtra what Arjun saw. The word aiśhwarya means “opulence.” The cosmic form of God is replete with the manifestation of his opulences, and it invokes fear, awe, and reverence in the beholder.\n",
