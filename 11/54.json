    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna emphasizes bhakti as the means for attaining him. Earlier, in verse 11.48, he had stated that his universal form can be seen only by devotion. Now, in this verse, Shree Krishna emphatically declares that his two-armed form as he is standing before Arjun can only be realized through bhakti. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures:bhaktirevaina\u1e41 nayati bhaktirevaina\u1e41 pa\u015bhyati bhaktirevaina\u1e41 dar\u015bhayati bhakti va\u015bha\u1e25 puru\u1e63ho bhaktireva gar\u012byas\u012b (M\u0101\u1e6dhar \u015ahruti)[v27]\u201cDevotion alone will unite us with God; devotion alone will help us see him; devotion alone will help us attain him; God is enslaved by true devotion, which is the best of all paths.\u201dna s\u0101dhayati m\u0101\u1e41 yogo na s\u0101nkhya\u1e41 dharma uddhavana sv\u0101dhy\u0101yas tapas ty\u0101go yath\u0101 bhaktir mamorjit\u0101 (Bh\u0101gavatam 11.14.20)[v28]\u201cUddhav, I come under the control of my devotees and am won over by them.

    "new_commentary": "This commentary focuses on the significance of bhakti (devotion) as the means to attain Lord Krishna. The verse highlights that only through bhakti can one realize Krishna's two-armed form, which is currently visible to Arjuna. Various Vedic scriptures emphasize that devotion alone can unite, help see, and attain God. Krishna states that he is won over by his devotees and can never be attained through other means such as yoga, philosophical studies, pious acts, austerities, or renunciation. He reiterates that only through bhakti, performed with faith, can one truly attain him. The commentary concludes by mentioning that the next verse describes the nature of bhakti."
