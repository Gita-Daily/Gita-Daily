    "translation": "\n\nBG 11.12:\r\n                            If a thousand suns were to blaze forth together in the sky, they would not match the splendor of that great form.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nSanjay now describes the effulgence of the universal form. To give an idea of its dazzling radiance, he compares it to thousands of suns blazing simultaneously in the midday sky. Actually, God’s effulgence is unlimited; it cannot be quantified in terms of the effulgence of the sun. However, narrators often describe the unknown by extrapolating from the known. The simile of a thousand suns expressed Sanjay’s perception that the splendor of the cosmic form had no parallels.\n",
