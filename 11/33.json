He has already decided the annihilation of the unrighteous and the victory of the righteous as the outcome of the battle. His grand scheme for the welfare of the world cannot be averted by any means. He now informs Arjun that he wishes him to be the nimitta-m\u0101tram, or the instrument of his work. God does not need the help of a human for his work, but humans attain eternal welfare by working to fulfill God\u2019s wish. Opportunities that come our way to accomplish something for the pleasure of the Lord are a very special blessing. It is by taking these opportunities that we attract his special grace, and achieve our permanent position as the servant of God.Shree Krishna also encourages Arjun to be his instrument by reminding him of the exceptional skills he has received in the art of archery by his grace. Hence, he addresses him with the vocative savya-s\u0101chin, meaning expert archer, since Arjun is admirably ambidextrous and is able to discharge arrows with either hand.\n", "next shlok": 34}
