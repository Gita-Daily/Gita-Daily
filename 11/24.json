    "commentary": "\nSeeing the cosmic form of God changed the nature of Arjun\u2019s relationship with Shree Krishna. Earlier, he had looked upon him as an intimate friend and interacted in a manner befitting a close associate. He was aware in the back of his head that Shree Krishna was God, but the love overflowing in his heart would make him forget the almighty aspect of Shree Krishna\u2019s personality. All he would remember was that he loved his friend Shree Krishna more than anything in the world.That is the nature of love. It absorbs the mind so deeply that the devotee forgets the formal position of his Beloved Lord. And if formality is retained, then love is unable to manifest in its fullness. For example, a wife loves her husband deeply. Though he may be the governor of the state, the wife only looks upon him as her husband, and that is how she is able to interact intimately with him. If she keeps this knowledge in her head that her husband is the governor, then each time he comes by, she will be inclined to stand on her feet and pay a more ceremonial respect for him. So, the knowledge of the official position of the beloved gets immersed in the loving sentiments. The same phenomenon takes place in devotion to God.The cowherds of Braj merely viewed Shree Krishna as their bosom buddy. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj describes their pastimes with Shree Krishna very sweetly:dekho dekho r\u012b, gw\u0101la b\u0101lana y\u0101r\u012b rijhavata khela jit\u0101ya sakhana ko, gho\u1e5b\u0101 bani bani banaw\u0101r\u012b(Prem Ras Madir\u0101, Rasiy\u0101 M\u0101dhuri, Pada 7)[v7]\u201cLook at the sweetness of the loving interactions between Shree Krishna and his cowherd friends! They play games together, and when Shree Krishna loses the game, he becomes a horse by sitting on all fours and his friend rides on his back.\u201d If the cowherd friends remembered that Shree Krishna was God, they would never have the gumption to do such a thing. And the Lord too relishes the intimacy of such interactions with his devotees in which they relate with him as a dear friend.Shree Krishna enacted the famous Goverdhan leela pastime upon the earth, in which he lifted the Goverdhan Hill on the little finger of his left hand, to protect the residents of the land of Braj from the rain caused by Indra, the king of heaven and the celestial god of rain. However, Krishna\u2019s little cowherd associates were not impressed. In their eyes, Krishna was merely a loveable friend, and so they did not believe he could lift the hill. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states in continuation to the verse above:nakha dh\u0101ryo goverdhana-giri jaba, sakhana kahyo hama giridh\u0101r\u012b (Prem Ras Madir\u0101, Rasiy\u0101 M\u0101dhur\u012b, Pada 7)[v8]\u201cWhen Shree Krishna lifted the Goverdhan Hill, his cowherd friends applied their sticks to the bottom of the hill, thinking that they were the actual lifters of the hill.\u201d At the end, Indra accepted defeat and came seated on his white elephant. He apologized for having sent the torrential rain, without realizing Shree Krishna\u2019s supreme position.Now, when the cowherd boys saw Indra, the King of heaven, coming and offering obeisance to their friend Krishna, they realized that Krishna is God. So, they began looking at him fearfully from a distance. Seeing their devotional sentiment change from friendship to awe and reverence, Shree Krishna lamented, \u201cThat loving exchange we were enjoying has vanished. They are now thinking I am God.\u201d So by his Yogmaya power, he made them forget the significance of what they had seen, and they again felt that Shree Krishna was nothing more than their friend.Arjun was also a devotee of Shree Krishna in sakhya bh\u0101v. He was used to relating to Shree Krishna as his friend. That is why he had agreed to having Shree Krishna as his chariot driver. If his devotion had been motivated by the fact that Shree Krishna was the Supreme Lord of all creation, Arjun would never have allowed him to do such a demeaning service. But now, seeing his infinite splendor and inconceivable opulences, his fraternal sentiment toward Shree Krishna was replaced by fear.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The nature of love is such that it absorbs the mind deeply, causing the devotee to forget the formal position of their beloved. Arjuna's relationship with Krishna transformed when he saw the cosmic form of God. Previously, he saw Krishna as a dear friend, but now he saw Him as the almighty. Similarly, the cowherds of Braj interacted intimately with Krishna without realizing His divinity. In the Goverdhan leela, Krishna lifted the hill to protect the residents, but his cowherd friends thought they were the actual lifters. When Indra apologized, they realized Krishna's supreme position. However, Krishna lamented the loss of their loving friendship, so he made them forget what they had seen. Arjuna also saw Krishna's infinite splendor and opulence, which replaced his fraternal sentiment with fear. This highlights the transformative power of experiencing God's true nature.",
