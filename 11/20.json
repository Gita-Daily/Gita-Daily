    "newest_commentary": "Arjuna recognizes the omnipresence of the Lord in all directions and the fear that arises from not observing the universal form. He implies that everyone acts under the influence of God's laws, being obligated to follow them. Just as the world functions based on the law of karma, where actions yield corresponding results, there are numerous other laws in existence. Scientists may discover and theorize physical laws, but they cannot create them. God is the ultimate law-maker, and all beings are subject to the authority of his laws."
