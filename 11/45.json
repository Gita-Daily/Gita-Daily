    "commentary": "\nThere are two kinds of bhakti\u2014ai\u015bhwarya bhakti and m\u0101dhurya bhakti. Ai\u015bhwarya bhakti is that where the devotee is motivated to engage in devotion by contemplating upon the almighty aspect of God. The dominant sentiment in ai\u015bhwarya bhakti is of awe and reverence. In such devotion, the feeling of remoteness from God and the need for maintaining propriety of conduct is always perceived. Examples of ai\u015bhwarya bhakti are the residents of Dwaraka and the residents of Ayodhya, who worshipped Shree Krishna and Lord Ram respectively as their kings. Ordinary citizens are highly respectful and obedient toward their king, although they never feel intimate with him.M\u0101dhurya bhakti is that where the devotee feels an intimate personal relationship with God. The dominant sentiment in such devotion is \u201cShree Krishna is mine and I am his.\u201d Examples of m\u0101dhurya bhakti are the cowherd boys of Vrindavan who loved Krishna as their friend, Yashoda and Nand baba, who loved Krishna as their child, and the gop\u012bs who loved him as their beloved. M\u0101dhurya bhakti is infinitely sweeter than ai\u015bhwarya bhakti. Hence, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:sabai sarasa rasa dw\u0101rik\u0101, mathur\u0101 aru braja m\u0101hi\u00f1madhura, madhuratara, madhuratama, rasa brajarasa sama n\u0101hi\u00f1 (Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 70)[v22]\u201cThe divine bliss of God is immensely sweet in all his forms. Yet, there is a gradation in it\u2014the bliss of his Dwaraka pastimes is sweet, the bliss of his Mathura pastimes is sweeter, and the bliss of his Braj pastimes is the sweetest.\u201dIn M\u0101dhurya bhakti, forgetting the almightiness of God, devotees establish four kinds of relationships with Shree Krishna:D\u0101sya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Master and I am his servant. The devotion of Shree Krishna\u2019s personal servants, such as Raktak, Patrak, etc. was in d\u0101sya bh\u0101v. The sentiment that God is our Father or Mother is a variation of d\u0101sya bh\u0101v and is included in it.Sakhya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Friend and I am his intimate companion. The devotion of the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, such as Shreedama, Madhumangal, Dhansukh, Mansukh, etc. was in sakhya bh\u0101v.V\u0101tsalya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Child and I am his parent. The devotion of Yashoda and Nand baba was in v\u0101tsalya bh\u0101v.M\u0101dhurya bh\u0101v\u2014Shree Krishna is our Beloved and I am his lover. The devotion of the gop\u012bs of Vrindavan was in m\u0101dhurya bh\u0101v.Arjun is a sakhya bh\u0101v devotee and relishes a fraternal relationship with the Lord. On seeing the universal form of God, Arjun experienced tremendous awe and reverence, and yet he longed for the sweetness of sakhya bh\u0101v that he was used to savoring. Hence, he prays to Shree Krishna to hide the almighty form that he is now seeing and again show his human form.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains two types of bhakti (devotion) in the Bhagavad Gita: ai\u015bhwarya bhakti, characterized by awe and reverence, and m\u0101dhurya bhakti, characterized by an intimate personal relationship with God. Examples of ai\u015bhwarya bhakti are the residents of Dwaraka and Ayodhya, who worshipped Krishna and Ram as their kings, respectively. Examples of m\u0101dhurya bhakti are the cowherd boys of Vrindavan, Yashoda and Nand baba, and the gop\u012bs who loved and had different relationships with Krishna. M\u0101dhurya bhakti is considered sweeter than ai\u015bhwarya bhakti. Arjuna, who is a sakhya bh\u0101v devotee, experiences both awe and reverence for the universal form of God, but longs for the sweetness of his previous fraternal relationship. He prays to Krishna to hide the almighty form and show his human form again."
