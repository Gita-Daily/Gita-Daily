    "translation": "The Blessed Lord said  Very hard indeed it is to see this form of Mine which thou hast seen. Even the gods are ever longing to behold it.Neither by the Vedas nor by austerity, nor by gift, nor by sacrifice can I be seen in this form as thou hast seen Me (so easily).",
    "commentary": "\nHaving shown Arjun the cosmic form, and having praised it as being unavailable to anyone but him, Shree Krishna does not want him to slacken his love for the personal form of God. Hence, Shree Krishna says that the way in which Arjun sees God is exceedingly rare. He emphasizes that even the celestial gods yearn to realize God in his two-armed personal form as he is standing before Arjun. This is not possible by any amount of Vedic studies, austerities, or fire sacrifices. The basic spiritual principle is that God cannot be known by the strength of one\u2019s efforts. However, those who engage in devotion to him become recipients of his grace. Then, by virtue of his grace, they are easily able to know him. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had states:n\u0101yam\u0101tm\u0101 pravachanena labhyo na medhay\u0101 na bahun\u0101 \u015bhrutena (3.2.3)[v26]\u201cGod cannot be known either by spiritual discourses or through the intellect; nor can he be known by hearing various kinds of teachings.\u201d If none of these means can help realize God in his personal form, then how can he be seen in this manner? He now reveals the secret.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the commentary of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna reminds Arjun that although he has shown him the cosmic form, it is important not to lose sight of the personal form of God. He emphasizes that even celestial gods aspire to realize God in his two-armed personal form. This realization cannot be attained through Vedic studies, austerities, or sacrifices, as God cannot be known through one's efforts alone. However, those who engage in devotion to him receive his grace and easily come to know him. The Mundakopanishad states that God cannot be known through discourses or intellect. Shree Krishna now reveals the secret of seeing God in his personal form.",
