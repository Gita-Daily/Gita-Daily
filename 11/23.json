    "newest_commentary": "The commentary states that God is omnipresent with numerous hands, legs, faces, and stomach. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had describes God as the Supreme Entity with thousands of heads, eyes, and feet. He resides within all humans, above the navel and in the heart. The universal form of the Lord encompasses both those who behold and those who are beheld, the fearsome and the terrified. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had adds that natural phenomena like fire, sun, wind, and rain all operate due to the fear of God. Even Yamraj, the god of death, trembles before him."
