If you consider me worthy of it, then by your grace, please reveal your cosmic form to me, and show me your Yog-ai\u015bhwarya (mystic opulence).\u201d Yog is the science of uniting the individual soul with the Supreme soul, and those who practice this science are called yogis. The word Yoge\u015bhwar also means \u201cLord of all yogis.\u201d Since the object of attainment for all yogis is the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna is consequently the Lord of all yogis. Previously, in verse 10.17, Arjun had addressed the Lord as \u201cYogi,\u201d implying \u201cMaster of yog.\u201d But he has now changed it to \u201cYogeshwar\u201d because of his increased respect for Shree Krishna.\n", "next shlok": 5}
