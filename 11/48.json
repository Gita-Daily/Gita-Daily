    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna declares that no amount of self-effort\u2014the study of the Vedic texts, performance of ritualistic ceremonies, undertaking of severe austerities, abstinence from food, or generous acts of charity\u2014is sufficient to bestow a vision of the cosmic form of God. This is only possible by his divine grace. This has been repeatedly stated in the Vedas as well:\ntasya no hr\u0101sva tasya no dhehi (Yajur Veda)[v24]\n\u201cWithout being anointed in the nectar of the grace of the Supreme Lord, nobody can see him.\u201d\nThe logic behind this is very straightforward. Our physical eyes are made from matter, and hence all that we can see is also material. The Supreme Lord is non-material\u2014he is divine. To have a vision of his divine form we need divine eyes. When God bestows his grace upon the soul, he adds his divine power to our material eyes, and only then can we see him.\nOne may ask that how was Sanjay also able to see that cosmic form, which Arjun saw by divine grace. The Mahabharat states that Sanjay also received by the grace of his Guru, Ved Vyas, who was an Avat\u0101r of God. Before the war, the Ved Vyas offered his student Sanjay divine vision so that he may be able to communicate the details of the war to Dhritarashtra. Hence, he saw the same cosmic form that Arjun saw. But later, when Duryodhan died, Sanjay was overwhelmed with grief and lost his divine vision.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that no amount of self-effort or worldly actions can enable one to have a vision of the cosmic form of God. It can only be attained through divine grace. The Vedas also emphasize the need for the grace of the Supreme Lord to experience His presence. Our physical eyes are material and can only perceive material objects, while God's form is divine. Divine eyes are necessary to see the divine form of God, which can be bestowed through His grace. Sanjay, through the grace of his Guru Ved Vyas, was able to see the cosmic form, similar to Arjun. However, after Duryodhan's death, Sanjay lost his divine vision due to overwhelming grief."
