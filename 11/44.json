    "commentary": "\nConsidering his behavior as transgressions toward God, Arjun is asking for pardon. While interacting with Shree Krishna\u2014playing, eating, jesting, talking, and resting\u2014he did not show the respect that is appropriate toward the Supreme Almighty. However, no one minds transgressions when they are made because of a high level of intimacy shared with the other person. No government officer has the privilege to joke with the President of a country. Yet, the President\u2019s personal friend, teases him, jests with him, and even scolds him. The President does not mind, rather he values that jest of an intimate friend more than all the respect he receives from his subordinate officers. Thousands of people salute an army general, but they are not as dear to his heart as his wife, who sits intimately by his side. Similarly, Arjun\u2019s intimate dealings with Shree Krishna were not transgressions; they were gestures of the depth of his loving devotion in the sentiment of being a friend. Yet, a devotee is by nature humble, and so, out of humility, he feels that he may have committed transgressions, and hence he is asking for forgiveness.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Arjuna seeks forgiveness from Lord Krishna for his behavior, acknowledging that he did not show appropriate respect towards the Supreme Almighty while interacting with him. The commentator compares this to the intimacy shared between friends, where transgressions are overlooked. The example of a personal friend joking with the President of a country is given to illustrate this point. Arjuna's intimate dealings with Krishna were not transgressions but gestures of his loving devotion as a friend. However, out of humility, Arjuna asks for forgiveness for any perceived transgressions. The commentary highlights the nature of a devotee, who is humble and seeks forgiveness even for unintentional mistakes.",
