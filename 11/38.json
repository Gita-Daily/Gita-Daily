He possesses complete knowledge and Bliss. He is omniscient, encompassing all knowledge. True knowledge leads us to understanding God. Any action performed in the service of God is considered true karma, and any knowledge that deepens our love for God is true j\u00f1\u0101na. Thus, Shree Krishna is both the source of knowledge and the ultimate object of knowledge."
