    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that renunciants often focus on a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog or ha\u1e6dha-yog alongside their practice of asceticism. They are not interested in the path of devotion, which involves meditation on God's Names, Forms, Pastimes, and Abodes. Shree Krishna describes the path followed by ascetics, who control their sight and breath to shut out thoughts of sense objects. They concentrate their gaze between the eyebrows, harmonize their breath, and enter a yogic trance. This process helps control the senses, mind, and intellect, leading to knowledge of the self (\u0101tma j\u00f1\u0101na) but not knowledge of God (brahma j\u00f1\u0101na). The commentary emphasizes that the ascetic path should be complemented with devotion to God for ultimate fulfillment."
