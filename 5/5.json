    "commentary": "\nIn spiritual practice, the intention of the mind is what matters, not the external activities.\u00a0 One may be living in the holy land of Vrindavan, but if the mind contemplates on eating rasgull\u0101s in Kolkata, one will be deemed to be living in Kolkata.\u00a0 Conversely, if a person lives amidst the hubbub of Kolkata and keeps the mind absorbed in the divine land\u00a0of Vrindavan, he will get the benefit of residing there.\u00a0 All the Vedic scriptures state that our level of consciousness is determined by the state of our mind:mana eva manu\u1e63hy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha mok\u1e63hayo\u1e25(Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b)\u201cThe mind is the cause of bondage, and the mind is the cause of liberation.\u201d\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states the same principle:bandhan aur mok\u1e63ha k\u0101, k\u0101ra\u1e47 manahi bakh\u0101ny\u0101te kauniu bhakti karu, karu mana te haridhy\u0101n(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 19)\u201cBondage and liberation depend upon the state of the mind.\u00a0 Whatever form of devotion you choose to do, keep the mind engaged in meditation upon God.\u201dThose who do not possess this spiritual vision see the external distinction between a karm sany\u0101s\u012b and a karm yogi, and declare the karm sany\u0101s\u012b to be superior because of the external renunciation.\u00a0 But those who are learned see that both the karm sany\u0101s\u012b and the karm yogi have absorbed their minds in God, and so they are both identical in their internal consciousness.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary emphasizes that in spiritual practice, the focus of the mind is crucial rather than external actions. It illustrates this with an example of someone living in Vrindavan but constantly thinking about eating rasgull\u0101s in Kolkata. The commentary states that our consciousness is determined by the state of our mind, which is the cause of both bondage and liberation. It quotes Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, who emphasizes the importance of keeping the mind engaged in meditation upon God. The commentary also discusses how people with limited spiritual vision may differentiate between a karm sany\u0101s\u012b and a karm yogi based on external renunciation, but those who are learned understand that both have a deep internal consciousness of God. Overall, the commentary underscores the significance of internal focus and consciousness in spiritual practice.",
