O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, so the wise do not delight in them.\r\n                        \n", "commentary": "\nThe senses create sensations of pleasure in contact with the sense objects.\u00a0 The mind, which is like the sixth sense, derives pleasure from honor, praise, circumstances, success, etc.\u00a0 All these pleasures of body and mind are known as bhog (material enjoyment).\u00a0 Such worldly pleasures cannot satisfy the soul for the following reasons:Worldly pleasures are finite, and hence the feeling of deficiency remains inherent in them.\u00a0 One may feel happiness on becoming a millionaire, but the same millionaire becomes discontented on seeing a billionaire, and thinks, \u201cIf only I also had one billion, then I too would be happy.\u201d\u00a0 In contrast, the bliss of God is infinite, and so it gives complete satisfaction.Worldly pleasures are temporary.\u00a0 Once they finish, they again leave one with the feeling of misery.\u00a0 For example, an alcoholic enjoys the pleasure of drinking alcohol at night, but the next morning, the hangover gives him a splitting headache.\u00a0 However, the bliss of God is eternal, and once attained, it remains forever.Worldly pleasures are insentient, and hence they continuously decrease.\u00a0 When people see a new Academy Award prize-winning movie, they are overjoyed, but if they have to see the movie a second time to give company to a friend, their joy dries up.\u00a0 And if a second friend insists that they see it a third time, they say, \u201cGive me any punishment, but don\u2019t ask me to see that movie again.\u201d\u00a0 The pleasure from material objects keeps decreasing as we enjoy it.\u00a0 In Economics, this is defined as the Law of Diminishing Returns.\u00a0 But the bliss of God is sentient; it is sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal ever-fresh divine bliss).\u00a0 Hence, one can go on chanting the same divine Name of God all day long, and relish ever-new devotional satisfaction in it.No sane person enjoying a delicious dessert would be willing to give it up and eat mud instead.\u00a0 Similarly, when one begins to enjoy divine bliss, the mind loses all taste for material pleasures.\u00a0 Those endowed with the faculty of discrimination understand the above three drawbacks of material pleasures, and restrain their senses from them.\u00a0\u00a0 Shree Krishna emphasizes this in the next verse.\n", "next shlok": 23}
