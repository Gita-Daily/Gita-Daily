However, brahma j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge of God) requires the grace of God, which comes through devotion. Shree Krishna emphasizes that the ascetic path is consummated in surrender to God, recognizing Him as the enjoyer of all austerities and sacrifices. According to Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj, true Yog is the union of the soul with the Lord, and no system of Yog is complete without the inclusion of bhakti (devotion). In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna includes various paths of spiritual practice, but always qualifies them by stating that success in these paths also requires bhakti. He repeatedly emphasizes the necessity of devotion. Therefore, true knowledge of God can only be attained through devotion and surrender to the Supreme Lord."
