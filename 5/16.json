    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains how the sun's power in removing darkness is incomparable. Just as the sun dispels darkness, the light of God's knowledge dispels the darkness of ignorance. Darkness creates illusions, like the illusion of reality in a cinema hall. When the main lights are switched on, the illusion is dispelled and people wake up. Similarly, in the darkness of ignorance, we identify ourselves with the body and consider ourselves as doers and enjoyers. But when the light of God's knowledge shines, the illusion retreats, and the soul realizes its true spiritual identity. The soul falls into illusion due to God's material energy, but this illusion is dispelled by God's spiritual energy illuminating it with knowledge.",
