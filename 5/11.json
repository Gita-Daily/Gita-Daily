    "commentary": "\nThe yogis understand that pursuing material desires in the pursuit of happiness is as futile as chasing the mirage in the desert.\u00a0 Realizing this, they renounce selfish desires, and perform all their actions for the pleasure of God, who alone is the bhokt\u0101ra\u1e41 yaj\u00f1a tapas\u0101m (Supreme enjoyer of all activities).\u00a0 However, in this verse, Shree Krishna brings a new twist to the samarpa\u1e47 (dedication of works to God).\u00a0 He says the enlightened yogis perform their works for the purpose of purification.\u00a0 How then do the works get dedicated to God?\u00a0The fact is that God needs nothing from us.\u00a0 He is the Supreme Lord of everything that exists and is perfect and complete in Himself.\u00a0 What can a tiny soul offer to the Almighty God, that God does not already possess?\u00a0 Hence, it is customary while making an offering to God to say:\u00a0 tvadiya\u1e41 vastu govinda tubhyameva samarpita\u1e41 \u201cO God, I am offering Your item back to You.\u201d\u00a0 Expressing a similar sentiment, Saint Yamunacharya states:mama n\u0101tha yad asti yo \u2019smyaha\u1e41 sakalam taddh\u012b tavaiva m\u0101dhavaniyata-svam iti prabuddha-dh\u0101ir atha v\u0101 ki\u1e41 nu samarpay\u0101mi te (\u015ahr\u012b Stotra Ratna, 50)\u201cO Lord Vishnu, husband of the Goddess of Fortune, when I was in ignorance, I thought I would give You many things.\u00a0 But now when I have gained knowledge, I realize that everything I own is already Yours.\u00a0 What then can I offer to You?\u201dHowever, there is one activity that is in our hands and not in God\u2019s hands; that is the purification of our own heart (mind and intellect).\u00a0 When we purify our heart and engage it in devotion to God, it pleases Him more than anything else.\u00a0 Realizing this, the great yogis make purification of their heart as the foremost goal, not out of selfishness, rather for the pleasure of God.Thus, the yogis understand that the biggest thing they can give to God is the purity of their own hearts and they work to achieve it.\u00a0 In the Ramayan, there is a sweet illustration of this principle.\u00a0 Lord Ram found Sugreev to be somewhat frightened before the battle of Lanka so He consoled him in the following manner:pi\u015bh\u0101ch\u0101n d\u0101nav\u0101n yak\u1e63h\u0101n p\u1e5bithivy\u0101\u1e41 chaiva r\u0101k\u1e63has\u0101na\u1e45gugre\u1e47a t\u0101nhany\u0101 michchhan har\u012b ga\u1e47e\u015bhvara\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0 (V\u0101lm\u012bki Ramayan)Lord Ram said, \u201cIf I, the Supreme Lord, merely bend the little finger of My left hand, what to speak of Ravan and Kumbhakarn, all the demons in the world will die.\u201d\u00a0 Sugreev responded, \u201cIf that is the case, my Lord, then in order to kill Ravan, what is the need for collecting this army?\u201d\u00a0 The Lord replied, \u201cThat is merely to give you all the opportunity to engage in devotional service for your own purification.\u00a0 However, do not assume that I need your help in annihilating these demons.\u201d\u00a0Our only permanent asset is the purity that we achieve.\u00a0 It goes with us into the next life, while all material assets get left behind.\u00a0 Hence in the final analysis, the success and failure of our life is determined by the extent to which we manage to achieve purity of heart.\u00a0 With this in view, elevated yogis welcome adverse circumstances, because they see them as opportunities for purifying the heart.\u00a0 Saint Kabir states:nindak niyare r\u0101khiye \u0101ngan ku\u1e6di chhab\u0101yanita s\u0101bun p\u0101n\u012b bin\u0101 nirmala kare subh\u0101ya\u201cIf you are desirous of quickly cleansing your heart, cultivate the company of a critic.\u00a0 When you tolerate his acrimonious words, your heart will be cleansed without water and soap.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, when purification of the heart is made the prime motive of actions, adversarial circumstances are then welcomed as God-sent opportunities for further progress, and one remains in equanimity in both success and failure.\u00a0 As we work for the pleasure of God, the heart gets purified; and as the heart gets purified, we naturally offer the results of all our actions to the Supreme Lord.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary from the Bhagavad Gita emphasizes the futility of pursuing material desires for happiness. Yogis renounce selfish desires and dedicate their actions to the pleasure of God. They understand that God needs nothing from them as He is the Supreme Lord of everything. Instead, they focus on purifying their own hearts, which pleases God more than anything else. The purification of the heart is the biggest offering one can give to God. The story of Lord Ram and Sugreev illustrates this principle. The yogis welcome adverse circumstances as opportunities for heart purification. Success and failure in life are determined by the extent to which one achieves purity of heart. Adversity is seen as a chance for progress. Cultivating the company of a critic helps cleanse the heart. As the heart gets purified, the results of actions are naturally offered to the Supreme Lord. The ultimate goal is achieving purity of heart through devotion to God."
