    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna compares karm sany\u0101s and karm-yog.\u00a0 It is a very deep verse; so let\u2019s understand it one word at a time.A karm yogi is one who does both, spiritual and social, duties.\u00a0 Social duties are done with the body while the mind is attached to God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:sochu mana yaha karm mama saba lakhata hari guru py\u0101re\u00a0\u00a0 (S\u0101dhan Bhakti Tattva)\u00a0\u201cDear one!\u00a0 Think always that all your actions are being observed by God and Guru.\u201d\u00a0 This is the s\u0101dhan\u0101 of karm-yog, by which we gradually elevate ourselves from bodily consciousness to spiritual consciousness.\u00a0Karm sany\u0101s is for elevated souls, who have already risen beyond the bodily platform.\u00a0 A karm sany\u0101s\u012b is one who discards social duties due to complete absorption in God, and engages entirely in the performance of spiritual duties (devotional service to God).\u00a0 This sentiment of karm sany\u0101s was nicely expressed by Lakshman, when Lord Ram asked him to fulfill his worldly duties:more sabai eka tumha sw\u0101m\u012b, d\u012bnabandhu ura antaray\u0101m\u012b\u00a0\u00a0 (Ramayan)Lakshman said to Ram, \u201cYou are my Master, Father, Mother, Friend, and everything.\u00a0 I will only fulfill my duty toward You with all my might.\u00a0 So please do not tell me about any of my bodily duties.\u201dThose who practice karm sany\u0101s do not consider themselves to be the body, and as a result, they do not feel obligated to discharge their bodily duties.\u00a0 Such karm sany\u0101s\u012bs dedicate their full time and energy to spirituality, while karm yogis have to split their time between worldly and spiritual duties.\u00a0 The karm sany\u0101s\u012bs can thus move much faster toward God, while the karm yogis are encumbered with social duties.\u00a0However, in this verse, Shree Krishna extols karm-yog beyond karm sany\u0101s and recommends it to Arjun as the preferred path.\u00a0 This is because karm sany\u0101s\u012bs are exposed to a danger.\u00a0 If, having renounced their duties they cannot absorb their mind in God, they are left neither here nor there.\u00a0 In India, there are tens of thousands of such sadhus, who felt they were detached, and thus, renounced the world, but their mind was not yet attached to God.\u00a0 Consequently, they could not experience the divine bliss of the spiritual path.\u00a0 And so, although wearing the saffron clothes of mendicants, they indulge in grossly sinful activities such as smoking opium.\u00a0 Only the ignorant mistake their sloth as detachment from the world.\u00a0On the other hand, karm yogis do both their worldly duties and spiritual practice.\u00a0 So if their mind turns away from spirituality, at least they have their work to fall back upon.\u00a0 Karm-yog is thus the safer path for majority of the people, while karm sany\u0101s is only to be pursued under the expert guidance of a Guru.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna compares karm sany\u0101s and karm-yog. A karm yogi performs spiritual and social duties, keeping the mind attached to God. Karm sany\u0101s is for elevated souls who discard social duties and focus solely on spiritual duties. Shree Krishna extols karm-yog as the preferred path because karm sany\u0101s\u012bs can face the danger of detachment without attachment to God. Many sadhus in India renounced the world but did not experience spiritual bliss because their minds were not attached to God. Karm yogis, on the other hand, do both worldly and spiritual duties, providing a safety net if their minds steer away from spirituality. Karm-yog is recommended for the majority, while karm sany\u0101s should only be pursued under the guidance of a Guru."
