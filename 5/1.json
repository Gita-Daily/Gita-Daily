    "commentary": "\nThis is the fifth of Arjun\u2019s sixteen questions.\u00a0 Shree Krishna praised both the renunciation of works and work with devotion.\u00a0 Arjun is confused by these apparently equivocal instructions and wishes to understand which of the two is more auspicious for him.\u00a0 Let us review the context of the question.The first chapter described the nature of Arjun\u2019s grief and created the setting for Shree Krishna to begin to relate spiritual knowledge to him.\u00a0 In the second chapter, Shree Krishna revealed to Arjun the science of the self and explained that since the soul is immortal, nobody would die in the war, and hence it was foolish to lament.\u00a0 He then reminded Arjun that his karm (social duty) as a warrior was to fight the war on the side of righteousness.\u00a0 But, since karm binds one to the fruits of actions, Shree Krishna encouraged Arjun to dedicate the fruits of his works to God.\u00a0 His actions would then become karm-yog, or \u201cunited with God through works.\u201d\u00a0In the third chapter, the Supreme Lord explained that performing one\u2019s duties is necessary because it helps to purify the mind.\u00a0 But He also said that a person who has already developed purity of mind is not obliged to perform any social duty (verse 3.17).\u00a0\u00a0In the fourth chapter, the Lord explained the various kinds of sacrifices (works that can be done for the pleasure of God).\u00a0 He concluded by saying that sacrifice performed in knowledge is better than mechanical ritualistic sacrifice.\u00a0 He also said that all sacrifice ends in the knowledge of one\u2019s relationship with God.\u00a0 Finally, in verse 4.41, He introduced the principle of karm sany\u0101s, in which ritualistic duties and social obligations are renounced and one engages in devotional service with the body, mind, and soul.\u00a0\u00a0These instructions perplexed Arjun.\u00a0 He thought that karm sany\u0101s (renunciation of works) and karm-yog (work in devotion) have opposite natures, and it is not possible to perform both simultaneously.\u00a0 Hence, he raises his doubt before Shree Krishna.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Arjuna raises his confusion about the apparently conflicting instructions of renunciation of works and work with devotion. The context of his question is set in the previous chapters, where Lord Krishna explains the science of the self and the immortality of the soul. He reminds Arjuna of his duty as a warrior and encourages him to dedicate the fruits of his works to God, creating a connection between works and devotion. In the third chapter, Lord Krishna explains the importance of performing duties to purify the mind, but also states that those with a purified mind are not obliged to perform social duties. In the fourth chapter, He emphasizes the superiority of sacrifice performed with knowledge and the ultimate knowledge of one's relationship with God. This leads to the introduction of the concept of karm sany\u0101s, renunciation of works and engagement in devotional service. Arjuna is puzzled by these teachings and seeks clarification from Lord Krishna."
