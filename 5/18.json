    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna emphasizes the importance of perceiving things with the eyes of knowledge and humility. Divine knowledge allows one to see all living beings as divine souls, irrespective of their external differences. Examples of contrasting species and life forms are given to illustrate this point. Shree Krishna explains that the Vedas do not support the notion of a higher caste for Brahmins and a lower caste for Shudras. Instead, individuals are seen as eternal souls and equal parts of God, regardless of their societal roles. This perspective of knowledge highlights the unity and equality among all beings."
