    "commentary": "\nThe human body presents a golden opportunity for the soul to reach the Supreme goal of God-realization.\u00a0 In this body, we possess the faculty of discrimination, while animals are driven by their nature.\u00a0 Shree Krishna emphasizes that this power of discrimination should be exercised to restrain the impulses of desire and anger.One meaning of the word k\u0101m is lust, but in this verse k\u0101m is used for all kinds of desires of the body and mind for material pleasures.\u00a0 When the mind does not attain the object of its desire, it modifies its state to exhibit anger.\u00a0 The urges of desire and anger are very powerful, like the strong current of a river.\u00a0 Even animals are subject to these urges, but unlike humans they are not bestowed with the discrimination to restrain them.\u00a0 However, the human intellect has been bestowed with the power of discrimination.\u00a0 The word sodhum means \u201cto withstand.\u201d\u00a0 This verse instructs us to withstand the urges of desire and anger.\u00a0 Sometimes one restrains the urges of the mind out of embarrassment.\u00a0 Let us say there is a man sitting at the airport.\u00a0 A beautiful lady comes and sits by his side.\u00a0 His mind desires the pleasure of putting his arm around her, but the intellect resists with the thought, \u201cThis is improper conduct.\u00a0 The lady may even slap me for it.\u201d\u00a0 To avoid the shame of censure, he restrains himself.\u00a0 Here Shree Krishna is not asking Arjun to restrain the mind out of embarrassment, fear, or apprehension, but through discrimination based on knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0The resolute intellect should be used to check the mind.\u00a0 As soon as the thought of savoring a material pleasure comes to the mind, one should bring the knowledge to the intellect that these are sources of misery.\u00a0 The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:\u00a0n\u0101ya\u1e41 deho deha-bh\u0101j\u0101\u1e41 n\u1e5biloke ka\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101n k\u0101m\u0101n arhate vi\u1e0d-bhuj\u0101\u1e41 yetapo divya\u1e41 putrak\u0101 yena sattva\u1e41 \u015bhuddhyed yasm\u0101d brahma-saukhya\u1e41 tvanantam\u00a0\u00a0 (5.5.1)\u201cIn the human form, one should not undertake great hardships to obtain sensual pleasures, which are available even to creatures that eat excreta (hogs).\u00a0 Instead, one should practice austerities to purify one\u2019s heart, and enjoy the unlimited bliss of God.\u201d\u00a0 This opportunity to practice discrimination is available only while the human body exists, and one who is able to check the forces of desire and anger while living, becomes a yogi.\u00a0 Such a person alone tastes the divine bliss within and becomes happy.\n",

Desires and anger are powerful impulses that even animals experience, but humans have the intellect to control them. This verse instructs us to withstand these urges. One should restrain the mind through discrimination based on knowledge. Material pleasures are sources of misery and practicing austerity purifies the heart to enjoy the unlimited bliss of God. This opportunity to practice discrimination is only available in the human form. Those who can control desires and anger become yogis and experience divine bliss.",
