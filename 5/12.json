    "new_commentary": "In this verse of the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna explains why some people are bound to material existence while others are released from it. Those who are unattached and not motivated by material rewards are never bound by karma, while those craving rewards and material pleasures become entangled in the reactions of their actions. Those who are united in consciousness with God and desire only purification of the heart relinquish the desire for rewards and engage in works for self-purification. They quickly attain divine consciousness and eternal bliss. On the other hand, those who are not united with God in consciousness and desire worldly rewards that are not beneficial to the soul become bound by the reactions of their actions, keeping them trapped in the cycle of life and death."
