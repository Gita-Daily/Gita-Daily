    "commentary": "\nIn the preceding verse, Shree Krishna explained the state of the sages who experience the pleasure of God within themselves.\u00a0 In this verse, He describes the state of the sages who are actively engaged in the welfare of all beings.\u00a0 The Ramayan states:para upak\u0101ra bachana mana k\u0101y\u0101, santa sahaja subh\u0101u khagar\u0101y\u0101\u201cThe trait of compassion is the intrinsic nature of saints.\u00a0 Motivated by it, they use their words, mind, and body for the welfare of others.\u201d\u00a0Human welfare is a praiseworthy endeavor.\u00a0 However, welfare schemes that are only committed to bodily care only result in temporary welfare.\u00a0 A person is hungry; he is given food, and his hunger is satiated.\u00a0 But after four hours, he is hungry again.\u00a0 Spiritual welfare goes right to the root of all material suffering, and endeavors to revive the God-consciousness of the soul.\u00a0 Hence, the highest welfare activity is to help a person unite his or her consciousness with God.\u00a0 This is the kind of welfare work that elevated souls with purified minds engage in.\u00a0 Such welfare activity further attracts God\u2019s grace, which elevates them even further on the path.\u00a0 Finally, when they have achieved complete purification of the mind and perfected their surrender to God, they are liberated to the spiritual realm and the divine Abode.\u00a0Thus far in this chapter, Shree Krishna has extolled the path of karm-yog.\u00a0 He now speaks the remaining verses for the karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, revealing that they too attain the final goal.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna discusses the state of sages who actively engage in the welfare of all beings. He emphasizes that human welfare should go beyond temporary solutions and aim to revive the God-consciousness of the soul. The ultimate welfare activity is to help individuals unite their consciousness with God. Elevated souls with purified minds engage in this kind of welfare work, which attracts God's grace and further elevates them on the spiritual path. When they have completely purified their minds and surrendered to God, they attain liberation to the divine realm. Shree Krishna previously extolled the path of karm-yog and now speaks about how karm sany\u0101s\u012bs also reach the final goal. This commentary highlights the importance of selfless service and spiritual welfare in attaining liberation and ultimate happiness.",
