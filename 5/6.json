    "commentary": "\nLiving in a cave in the Himalayas, a yogi may feel that he has renounced, but the test of that renunciation comes when he returns to the city.\u00a0 For instance, one sadhu practiced austerities for twelve years in the mountains of Garhwal.\u00a0 He came down to Haridwar to participate in the holy fair called Kumbh Mel\u0101.\u00a0 In the hustle and bustle of the fair, someone accidentally placed his shoe on the sadhu\u2019s bare foot.\u00a0 The sadhu \u00a0was infuriated, and screamed, \u201cAre you blind?\u00a0 Can you not see where you are going?\u201d\u00a0 Later he repented for permitting anger to overcome him, and lamented, \u201cTwelve years of austerities in the mountains got washed away by living one day in the city!\u201d\u00a0 The world is the arena where our renunciation gets tested.In this verse, Shree Krishna says that while performing one\u2019s duties in the world, a person should slowly learn to rise above anger, greed, and desire.\u00a0 Instead, if one first gives up duties, it is very difficult to purify the mind; and without a pure mind, true detachment remains a distant dream.\u00a0We are all propelled to work by our nature.\u00a0 Arjun was a warrior, and if he had artificially renounced his duty, to retire to the forest, his nature would make him work there as well.\u00a0 He would probably gather a few tribesmen and declare himself their king.\u00a0 Instead, it would be more fruitful to use his natural inclinations and talents in the service of God.\u00a0 So the Lord instructs him, \u201cContinue to fight, but make one change.\u00a0 At first, you came to this battleground on the presumption of saving a kingdom.\u00a0 Now, instead, simply dedicate your service unselfishly to God.\u00a0 In this way, you will naturally purify the mind and achieve true renunciation from within.\u201d\u00a0A tender and unripe fruit clings fast to the tree that bears and nourishes it.\u00a0 But the same fruit, when fully ripe, severs its connection from its sustainer.\u00a0 Similarly from the material existence, the karm yogi gets the experience that matures into wisdom.\u00a0 Just as sound sleep is only possible for those who have worked hard, deep meditation comes to those who have purified their minds through karm-yog.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary focuses on the test of renunciation when a yogi returns to the city. It narrates the story of a sadhu who lost his temper at a fair, showing that true renunciation is challenging in the worldly arena. The verse emphasizes the importance of rising above anger, greed, and desire while fulfilling one's duties. Giving up duties without purifying the mind makes true detachment difficult to achieve. Arjun's natural inclination as a warrior is used as an example to illustrate that he should continue to fight but dedicate his service unselfishly to God. By doing so, his mind will naturally purify and true renunciation will be attained. The analogy of a fruit clinging to a tree and eventually detaching is used to explain how the karm yogi gains wisdom through experience. Just as sound sleep comes after hard work, deep meditation comes to those who purify their minds through karm-yog.",
