    "commentary": "\nBoth Hindu and Buddhist scriptures abound with analogies of the lotus flower.\u00a0 The word is used as a respectful appellation while describing various parts of God\u2019s divine body.\u00a0 Hence chara\u1e47-kamal means \u201clotus-like feet,\u201d kamalek\u1e63ha\u1e47a means \u201clotus-like eyes,\u201d kar-kamal means \u201clotus-like hands,\u201d etc.Another word for the lotus flower is pa\u1e45kaj, which means \u201cborn from mud.\u201d\u00a0 The lotus flower grows from the mud found at the bottom of the lake, yet it rises above the water and blossoms toward the sun.\u00a0 Thus, the lotus flower is often used in Sanskrit literature as an example of something that is born amidst the dirt, and rises above it while retaining its beautiful purity.\u00a0Further, the lotus plant has large leaves that float atop the water surface of the lake.\u00a0 Lotus leaves are used in Indian villages for plates, as they are waterproof, and liquid poured on them does not soak through, but runs off.\u00a0 The beauty of the lotus leaf is that, although the lotus owes its birth, growth, and sustenance to the water, the leaf does not permit itself to be wetted.\u00a0 Water poured on the lotus leaf runs off the side, due to the small hair growing on its surface.\u00a0With the help of the beautiful analogy of the lotus leaf, Shree Krishna says that just as it floats atop the surface of the lake, but does not allow itself to be wetted by the water, similarly, the karm yogis remain untouched by sin, although performing all kinds of works, because they perform their works in divine consciousness.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary reflects on the symbolism of the lotus flower in Hindu and Buddhist scriptures. The lotus is used to describe different parts of God's divine body, representing purity and beauty. The flower grows from the mud but rises above the water, symbolizing the ability to transcend worldly impurities while maintaining inner purity. The lotus leaf, used as a plate in Indian villages, remains dry despite being in contact with water due to its surface structure. Shree Krishna compares the karm yogis to the lotus leaf, stating that they perform their actions in divine consciousness and remain untouched by sin. The analogy emphasizes the importance of carrying out one's duties in a state of spiritual awareness.",
