    "newest_commentary": "The commentary describes God as an ocean of unlimited divine bliss. Various scriptures affirm that God's form and nature are composed of pure bliss. The yogi who devotes themselves to God experiences the infinite bliss that resides within. The Vedic scriptures repeatedly emphasize that God is synonymous with bliss and happiness. By immersing oneself in God, the senses, mind, and intellect begin to perceive this innate bliss. God's hands, feet, face, and stomach are said to be made of bliss. Ultimately, knowing and realizing God means recognizing and attaining the state of eternal divine bliss."
