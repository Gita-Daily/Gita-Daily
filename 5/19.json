    "commentary": "\nSri Krishna uses the word s\u0101mye to mean one possessed of an equal vision toward all living beings, as explained in the previous verse.\u00a0 Further, equality in vision also means to rise beyond likes and dislikes, happiness and misery, pleasure and pain.\u00a0 Shree Krishna says that those who are able to do so transcend the samsara of repeated birth and death.So long as we think of ourselves as the body, we cannot attain this equality of vision because we will experience continued desires and aversions for bodily pleasures and discomforts.\u00a0 Saints rise above bodily consciousness and absorb their minds in God, giving up all worldly attachments.\u00a0 The Ramayan states:sevahi\u1e45 lakhanu s\u012bya raghub\u012brahi, jimi abibek\u012b puru\u1e63ha sar\u012brahi.\u201cLakshman served Lord Ram and Sita, just as an ignorant person serves his body.\u201d\u00a0When one\u2019s mind is situated in this divine consciousness, attachment to bodily pleasures and pains get transcended, and one reaches a state of equanimity.\u00a0 This equipoise that comes through the sacrifice of selfish bodily desires makes one godlike in demeanor.\u00a0 The Mahabharat states: yo na k\u0101mayate ki\u00f1chit brahma bh\u016by\u0101ya kalpate \u00a0\u201cOne who gives up desires becomes like God.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Sri Krishna explains that equality in vision means to rise above likes and dislikes, happiness and misery. By transcending attachment to the body and worldly desires, one can attain a state of equanimity. The Ramayan illustrates this with the example of Lakshman serving Lord Ram and Sita, similar to how an ignorant person serves their body. When the mind is absorbed in divine consciousness, attachment to bodily pleasures and pains is surpassed, leading to a godlike demeanor. The Mahabharat further emphasizes that giving up desires results in becoming like God. Thus, by attaining an equal vision and sacrificing selfish desires, one can transcend the cycle of birth and death."
