    "commentary": "\nIn the last verse of this chapter, Shree Krishna declares that: those yogis who follow the path of light reap the fruits of their endeavours beyond any other processes can bestow. He says that even though one may undertake Vedic sacrifices, perform austerities, charity, or accumulate knowledge of the self, but without devotion to God, it is not the path of light. The Ramayan states:nema dharma \u0101ch\u0101ra tapa gy\u0101na jagya japa d\u0101na,bhe\u1e63haja puni ko\u1e6dinha nahi\u1e45 roga j\u0101hi\u1e45 harij\u0101na.\u201cYou may engage in good conduct, righteousness, austerities, sacrifices,\u00a0ashtanga yoga, chanting of mantras, and charity.\u00a0 But without devotion to God, the mind\u2019s disease of material consciousness will not cease.\u201dAll these good deeds can only reap material rewards, which are temporary. However, devotion to God leads to liberation from the bondage of the material world. Therefore, the yogis who have realized this truth detach their mind from the material world and attach it to God alone. Treading on this path of light, they eventually attain eternal happiness.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "In the last verse of this chapter, Shree Krishna explains that only those yogis who follow the path of light can attain the highest fruits of their efforts. He emphasizes the importance of devotion to God, stating that performing Vedic sacrifices, austerities, charity, or accumulating knowledge without devotion will not lead to enlightenment. Good deeds and material rewards are temporary, but devotion to God brings liberation from the material world. Realizing this, yogis detach their minds from the material and focus solely on God, ultimately finding eternal happiness on the path of light."
