He says that even though one may undertake Vedic sacrifices, perform austerities, charity, or accumulate knowledge of the self, but without devotion to God, it is not the path of light. The Ramayan states:nema dharma \u0101ch\u0101ra tapa gy\u0101na jagya japa d\u0101na,bhe\u1e63haja puni ko\u1e6dinha nahi\u1e45 roga j\u0101hi\u1e45 harij\u0101na.\u201cYou may engage in good conduct, righteousness, austerities, sacrifices,\u00a0ashtanga yoga, chanting of mantras, and charity.\u00a0 But without devotion to God, the mind\u2019s disease of material consciousness will not cease.\u201dAll these good deeds can only reap material rewards, which are temporary. However, devotion to God leads to liberation from the bondage of the material world. Therefore, the yogis who have realized this truth detach their mind from the material world and attach it to God alone. Treading on this path of light, they eventually attain eternal happiness.\n", "next shlok": 29}
