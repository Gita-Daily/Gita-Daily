    "commentary": "\nIn the Vedas, God is referred by many names: Brahman, Bhagwan, Deva, Param\u0101tm\u0101, Pra\u1e47a, Puru\u1e63h, Sat, etc. In some places, while referring to His formless aspect, God is said to be Akshar, which means imperishable. The B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:etasya v\u0101 ak\u1e63harasya pra\u015bh\u0101sane g\u0101rgis\u016bry\u0101chandramasau vidh\u1e5bitau ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhata\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3.8.9)\u201cUnder the mighty control of the Imperishable, the sun and the moon are held on their course.\u201dShree Krishna mentions in this verse the word sangrahe\u1e47a,\u00a0which means \u201cin brief.\u201d He says that this path is very difficult to follow and not suitable for everyone. Therefore, He will not elaborate much and briefly describe this path of yog-mi\u015bhr\u0101 bhakti; that leads to attaining the formless aspect of God. It demands living a life of rigid continence and perform severe austerities. Renouncing worldly desires and practicing brahmacharya, a vow of celibacy. As was previously detailed in verse 6.14, the practice of celibacy conserves a person\u2019s physical energy. This energy, when channelized through sadhana, gets transformed into spiritual energy. It also enhances the intellect and memory power of the s\u0101dhaks (spiritual aspirants) and helps them comprehend the spiritual subjects better.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, the various names of God mentioned in the Vedas are highlighted, including Brahman, Bhagwan, and Deva. The concept of God being formless and imperishable is explained through the term Akshar. Shree Krishna briefly describes the path of yog-mi\u015bhr\u0101 bhakti, emphasizing that it is difficult and not suitable for everyone. This path requires strict continence, renouncing worldly desires, and practicing celibacy. The practice of celibacy conserves physical energy, which can be channeled into spiritual energy through sadhana. It also enhances intellect and memory power, aiding in the comprehension of spiritual subjects."
