    "commentary": "\nThe Vedas address God by several names; Brahman is one of them. In this verse, Shree Krishna says to Arjun that the Supreme Entity is called the Brahman. Time, space, the chain of cause and effect, etc., are all characteristics of the material realm. However, the Brahman is beyond these, as He is transcendental to the material plane. He is described as aksharam or indestructible because He is unaffected by the changes in the universe.\u00a0The Brihadaranyak Upanishad 3.8.8 states,\u00a0\u201cLearned people speak of Brahman as\u00a0akshar\u00a0(indestructible).\u00a0 It is also designated as\u00a0Param\u00a0(Supreme) because It possesses qualities beyond those possessed by maya and the souls.\u201dThe word adhyatma has two meanings in Sanskrit. One is the science of the soul, and the second is the path to spirituality. However, here Shree Krishna has used it for one\u2019s own self that includes the body, mind, and intellect.Karmas are fruitive activities performed by a person. It is these karmas that forge every individual\u2019s distinct conditions of existence in various lifetimes. They keep the soul circling in samsara or the cycle of material existence.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that the Supreme Entity is called Brahman, which is beyond the material realm. Brahman is described as indestructible and supreme, possessing qualities beyond maya and the souls. The term adhyatma refers to the science of the soul and the path to spirituality, as well as one's own self including the body, mind, and intellect. Karmas are fruitive activities that shape an individual's conditions of existence throughout different lifetimes, causing the soul to circle in samsara, the cycle of material existence."
