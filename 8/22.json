The same Supreme Lord who resides in the spiritual sky in His divine abode, at the same time, is seated in the hearts of every living creature. He is all-pervading and present in every atom of the material world. It is not that He is a hundred percent God in His personal form and ten percent when He is in our hearts or anywhere else in the material world. God exists a hundred percent in all His forms. Due to our ignorance, we are unable to recognize His presence within us or all around us.Sage Shandilya states in his Bhakti Darshan:gav\u0101\u1e41 sarpi\u1e25 \u015bhar\u012brastha\u1e41 na karotya\u1e45ga po\u1e63ha\u1e47am\u201cMilk resides in the body of the cow, but it does not benefit the health of the cow, which is weak and sick.\u201d\u00a0When the same milk is converted to yogurt and fed to the cow with a little black pepper, it cures the cow; of its illness.Likewise, it is difficult to develop devotion for an omnipresent or all-pervading God. Worshiping Him in His divine form helps us purify our heart, which is necessary to attract His divine grace. Because, to perceive God\u2019s divinity, we need our senses to be divine. By His grace, His divine energy Yogmaya instills in us divine senses, mind, and intellect so that we could know both His all-pervading aspect and His personal form. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna declares that only through bhakti can we know Him.In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna has repeatedly emphasized upon the need for bhakti to know God and attain Him. The verse 6.47 states: Shree Krishna considers those engaged in devotion as the highest in position among His devotees. However, in this verse, Shree Krishna explicitly adds the term ananyay\u0101, which means \u201cby no other path\u201d can one know God.\u00a0Chaitanya Mahaprabhu very nicely said:bhakti mukha nir\u012bk\u1e63haka karm yoga j\u00f1\u0101na (Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya 22.17)\u201cAlthough\u00a0karma, jnana, and ashtanga yoga\u00a0are also pathways to God-realization, all these require the support of bhakti for their fulfillment.\u201d\u00a0Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also said:karm yog aru j\u00f1\u0101na saba, s\u0101dhana yadapi bakh\u0101npai binu bhakti sabai janu, m\u1e5bitaka deha binu pr\u0101n(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 8)\u201cAlthough\u00a0karma, jnana, and\u00a0ashtanga yoga are paths to God-realization, without blending bhakti in them, they all become like dead bodies without life-airs.\u201d\u00a0Various other scriptures also announce the same:bhakty\u0101hamekay\u0101 gr\u0101hya\u1e25 \u015bhraddhay\u0101tm\u0101 priya\u1e25 sat\u0101m\u00a0\u00a0(Bhagavatam 11.14.21)\u201cI am only attained by My devotees who worship Me with faith and love.\u201dmilahi\u1e45 na raghupati binu anur\u0101g\u0101, kie\u00f1 joga tapa gy\u0101na bir\u0101g\u0101\u00a0\u00a0(Ramayan)\u201cOne may practice\u00a0ashtanga yoga, engage in austerities, accumulate knowledge, and develop detachment.Yet, without devotion, one will never attain God.\u201d\u00a0\n", "next shlok": 23}
