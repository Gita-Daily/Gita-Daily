    "commentary": "\nThe cosmic play of the various planes of existence in the universe is astounding. The fourteen worlds and their planetary systems undergo repeated cycles of s\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di, sthiti,\u00a0and\u00a0pralaya (creation, preservation, and dissolution). All planetary systems, up to the Mahar Lok, are destroyed at the end of a kalp; that is Brahma\u2019s day of 4.32 billion years. This partial dissolution is called naimittik pralaya. When Shukdev Paramhans narrated the Shrimad Bhagavatam to Parikshit, he stated that Brahma creates these worlds similar to a child playing with his toys. A child builds structures with his toys during the day and pulls them apart before going to bed at night. Similarly, when Brahma wakes up, he creates the planetary systems and their life forms and dissolves them before going to sleep.The entire universe dissolves at the end of Brahma\u2019s life of 100 years (311.04 trillion earth years). The whole material creation winds up. The\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta\u00a0merge into the\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s, the\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s\u00a0merge into\u00a0ahank\u0101r,\u00a0ahank\u0101r\u00a0merges into\u00a0mah\u0101n, and\u00a0mah\u0101n\u00a0merges into\u00a0prak\u1e5biti. Prak\u1e5biti\u00a0is the subtle form of Maya, the material energy of God.\u00a0Maya now takes up her primordial form. She goes back into the body of the Supreme Lord, Maha Vishnu. This great dissolution is called pr\u0101k\u1e5bit pralaya, or\u00a0mah\u0101pralaya. When it is time for the next cycle\u00a0of creation, Maha Vishnu glances at prak\u1e5biti, and by His mere glance, prak\u1e5biti starts unfolding herself again. From\u00a0prak\u1e5biti,\u00a0mah\u0101n\u00a0is created, from\u00a0mah\u0101n,\u00a0ahank\u0101r; then from\u00a0ahank\u0101r,\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s\u00a0are created; from\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-tanm\u0101tr\u0101s,\u00a0pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta\u00a0get created.\u00a0 And by this process, unlimited universes are created again.According to modern science, there are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way. And similar to the Milky Way, there are over a billion galaxies in the universe. Thus, scientists have concluded that in our universe, there are more than 10^20 stars. However, the Vedas state that, similar to our universe, there are infinite universes of various sizes and different features. These universes manifest from the body of Maha Vishnu. Every time He breathes in infinite universes are created from the pores of His divine body. And when He breathes out, they dissolve again. Thus, one breath of Maha Vishnu is equal to 100 years of Brahma\u2019s life. Also, all these universes have their own Brahma, Vishnu, and Shankar. In the innumerable universes, there are innumerable Brahmas, Vishnus, and Shankars. The entire creation originates from Maha Vishnu, and\u00a0at dissolution, merges back into Him.\n",
