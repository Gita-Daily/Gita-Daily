When we see, hear, touch, taste, or smell an object of perception, it leaves an impression on our mind. Our mind then dwells upon these experiences, starts to contemplate, and creates repetitive thoughts that increase our attachment to the world. Therefore, a practitioner of meditation should guard himself against the incessant stream of worldly thoughts that the unrestrained senses can create. Locking the world out by restraining the mind and the senses; is most essential in meditation.In this verse, Shree Krishna uses the words sarva-dv\u0101r\u0101\u1e47i-sanyamya, which mean guarding the gates of the body, and h\u1e5bidi nirudhya\u00a0that means \u201clocking the mind in the heart.\u201d He says that by controlling the passages that enter the body, one can lock the mind in the heart. Restricting the senses from their natural tendencies and directing the mind toward ak\u1e63haram\u00a0the imperishable Supreme Lord. Then with complete attention and devotional feelings, one should meditate on Him. He ends the verse with yoga-dh\u0101ra\u1e47\u0101m,\u00a0which means \u201cuniting the consciousness with God.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 13}
