    "commentary": "\nThe spiritual realm has a divine sky called the Paravyom, where all the different forms of God have their eternal abodes called the Lokas. The Supreme Lord resides in His various divine forms in these Lokas along with His eternal associates. Golok is the divine abode of Lord Krishna, Saket Lok is the abode of Lord Ram, Vaikunth Lok is the abode of Lord Vishnu, Shiv Lok is the abode of Lord Shiv, Devi Lok is the abode of Divine Mother Durga, etc. These divine forms are non-different from the Supreme Lord; they are all divine forms of the same one God. A devotee may worship any of the forms of God and strive to attain Him. Once God-realized, their soul will reach the divine Lok of that form of God and remain there forever. It receives a divine body and participates in the divine pastimes and activities of the Lord.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "The spiritual realm has various divine abodes called Lokas, where different forms of God reside. Golok is the abode of Lord Krishna, Saket Lok is for Lord Ram, Vaikunth Lok for Lord Vishnu, Shiv Lok for Lord Shiv, Devi Lok for Divine Mother Durga, etc. These forms are non-different from the Supreme Lord. A devotee can worship any form and strive to attain Him. Once God-realized, the soul reaches the divine Lok of that form and engages in divine activities with a divine body. The Lokas are eternal abodes in the divine sky called the Paravyom. In summary, the commentary explains the concept of divine Lokas and how devotees can attain them by worshipping different forms of God."
