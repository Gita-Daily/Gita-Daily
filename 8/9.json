The Names, Forms, Leelas (Pastimes), Associates, and Abodes of God. There is no difference among all these aspects of God. Therefore, one can meditate on any one or all of them. Such meditation, where we attach our mind to the Supreme Divinity, takes our mind to the divine realm, and as a result, it purifies.In this verse, Shree Krishna has mentioned eight such divine aspects of God:1.\u00a0Kavi: Like a poet who knows the entirety of his creation, God is omniscient. He is the seer who knows the past, present, and future, as mentioned in verse 7.26.2.\u00a0Pur\u0101\u1e47am:\u00a0 God is the most ancient, and nothing predates Him. He is the origin of the entire material and spiritual world, but He has not originated from anything. God is without a beginning or an end.3.\u00a0Anu\u015bh\u0101sit\u0101ram:\u00a0God is the governor or the ruler. He administers His regime through the celestial gods that He has appointed or sometimes directly. He is the creator, and everything in this universe is under His control and run by His law.4.\u00a0A\u1e47ora\u1e47\u012by\u0101n: Here God is said to exist in the subtlest or subatomic form. The soul is subtler than matter, but God is even subtler than the soul, as He is seated within every soul.5.\u00a0Sarvasya Dh\u0101t\u0101: God is the source of sustenance. Similar to an ocean that sustains the waves and its vast marine ecology. God is the support for His entire creation.6.\u00a0Achintya r\u016bpa: God exists in inconceivable forms. Our mind and intellect are material in nature, and God is divine, thus, beyond our understanding. It is only through His grace one can understand Him. He bestows His divine grace and makes our mind divine by His Yogmaya power; only then can we know Him.7.\u00a0\u0100ditya var\u1e47a: \u00a0\u0100ditya is one of the names of the sun god. Here, God is said to be dazzling like the sun.8.\u00a0Tamasa\u1e25 Parast\u0101t: Similar to the sun that eradicates darkness, God with His effulgence eliminates ignorance. On a cloudy day, the sun is not visible, but it is an optical illusion for us. The sun is where it is, unaffected by the clouds in the earth\u2019s atmosphere. Similarly, during His Leelas or pastimes, God may seem to be covered by His material energy, Maya. However, He is unaffected by it. \u00a0He is beyond darkness and ignorance.\u00a0One may ask, why so much variety. Western scholars often get confused by the various philosophies, paths, and instructions given in the Vedic scriptures. Therefore, it is stressed in the Hindu scriptures to study them under the guidance of an able Guru.We all have different choices and natures according to our\u00a0sansk\u0101rs\u00a0(tendencies) from endless lifetimes. Consider this example of two people going into a cloth shop. The chances of both of them buying the same type, color, or style of clothes is very rare. Therefore, the shops keep a variety of clothes and cater to the choices and preferences of people. Similarly, the Vedic scriptures also offer various spiritual paths so that based on the level of sadhana that we may have performed in our past lives, we may choose a suitable path. However, they simultaneously stress on bhakti or devotion to God that ties together all these paths in one common thread.The Bhagavad Gita beautifully embraces varieties of sadhanas to cater to a large populace belonging to diverse backgrounds, upbringing, and natures. Bhakti involves focusing the mind upon God, in His various divine Forms, Qualities, Pastimes, etc. In its pure form, bhakti is called \u015bhuddha bhakti. However, when undertaken along with\u00a0ashtanga yoga, it is termed yog-mi\u015bhra bhakti or a fusion of devotion and\u00a0ashtanga yoga sadhana.Shree Krishna has described yog-mi\u015bhra bhakti from verse ten to thirteen. In the practice of ashtanga yoga, the life force or pr\u0101n shakti is channelized through su\u1e63hum\u1e47\u0101 n\u0101di of the spinal column and then raised toward the third eye region between the eyebrows. In this verse, He says that at the time of death, one who performs this with great devotion and complete focus on the Divine Lord will definitely achieve Him.\n", "next shlok": 11}
