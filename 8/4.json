    "commentary": "\nThe universe is a kaleidoscope of all the physical manifestations of the five elements of nature: earth, water, fire, air, and space. This ever-changing universe is called adhibhuta. Although the devatas or the celestial gods administer the different departments of the universe, God has sovereignty, even over the devatas. He is Vir\u0101\u1e6d Purusha, the complete cosmic personality who encompasses the entire material creation. Hence, God is called Adhidaiva.\u00a0Shree Krishna says that as the Supreme Soul or Paramatma,\u00a0He dwells in the hearts of all living beings of the universe. He is the one who bestows rewards for all our actions and the presiding divinity for all the yajna (sacrifices). Thus, He is also called Adhiyajna, or the Lord of all sacrifices. Therefore, all yajna should be performed; for the satisfaction of this Supreme Divine Personality.So far, Shree Krishna has answered six out of the seven questions concerning the meanings of the various terms Arjun had asked at the beginning of this chapter. In the next few verses, Shree Krishna will answer Arjun\u2019s seventh question regarding the moment of death.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the universe is composed of the five elements and is constantly changing. While celestial gods govern different aspects of the universe, God has ultimate sovereignty over them. God, known as Vir\u0101\u1e6d Purusha and Adhidaiva, encompasses the entire material creation. Krishna asserts that he is the Supreme Soul dwelling in the hearts of all beings and rewards their actions. He is also the presiding divinity for all sacrifices, known as Adhiyajna. Krishna has answered six of Arjuna's questions about the meanings of various terms, and in the upcoming verses, he will address Arjuna's final question about the moment of death.",
