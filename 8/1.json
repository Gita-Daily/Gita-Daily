Also, that the enlightened souls are in full consciousness of Him even at the time of their death. Hearing this, Arjun is curious and wants to know more. In these two verses, he puts forth to Shree Krishna seven questions, out of which six are about these words, and the seventh question is regarding remembering God at the time of death. Since Shree Krishna had Himself introduced these subjects, Arjun wants Him to elaborate upon them.\n",

He also asks about the significance of remembering God at the time of death. Arjun's questions arise from his curiosity and Shree Krishna's previous mention of these topics. Arjun requests Shree Krishna to provide a detailed explanation and elaborate on these subjects."
