    "commentary": "\nDivine knowledge of God is not attained by the flight of our intellect. No matter how powerful a mental machine we may possess, we have to admit the fact that our intellect is made from the material energy. Hence, our thoughts, understanding, and wisdom are confined to the material realm; God and his divine realm remain entirely beyond the scope of our corporeal intellect. The Vedas emphatically declare:yasy\u0101 mata\u1e41 tasya mata\u1e41 mata\u1e41 yasya na veda sa\u1e25avij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 vij\u0101nat\u0101\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101tamavij\u0101nat\u0101m(Kenopani\u1e63had 2.3)[v9]\u201cThose who think they can understand God with their intellects have no understanding of God. Only those who think that he is beyond the scope of their comprehension truly understand him.\u201dThe B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had states:sa e\u1e63ha neti nety\u0101tm\u0101 g\u1e5bihyo\u1e25\u00a0(3.9.26)[v10]\u201cOne can never comprehend God by self-effort based upon the intellect.\u201d The Ramayan states:r\u0101ma atarkya buddhi mana b\u0101n\u012b, mata ham\u0101ra asa sunahi say\u0101n\u012b [v11]\u201cLord Ram is beyond the scope of our intellect, mind, and words.\u201d Now, if these statements on the topic of knowing God plainly declare that it is not possible to know him, how then can God-realization be possible for anyone? Shree Krishna reveals here how knowledge of God can be gained. He says that it is God who bestows divine knowledge upon the soul, and the fortunate soul who receives his grace is able to know him. The Yajur Veda states:tasya no r\u0101sva tasya no dheh\u012b [v12]\u201cWithout bathing oneself in the nectar emanating from the lotus feet of God, no one can know him.\u201d Thus, true knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace. Shree Krishna also mentions in this verse that he does not choose the recipient of his grace in a whimsical manner. Rather, he bestows it upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion. He next talks about what happens when we receive divine grace.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary emphasizes that divine knowledge of God cannot be attained through intellectual efforts alone. Our human intellect is limited to the material realm, while God and his divine realm are beyond its scope. The Upanishads and scriptures affirm that those who think they can comprehend God with their intellects truly lack understanding. Self-effort based on intellect cannot lead to the comprehension of God. Lord Ram is also described as beyond the reach of our intellect, mind, and words. However, Shree Krishna explains that divine knowledge is bestowed upon the fortunate soul by God. The Yajur Veda states that bathing in the nectar of God's lotus feet is necessary to know him. True knowledge of God is not a result of intellectual gymnastics but a consequence of divine grace. Shree Krishna further adds that he bestows his grace upon those who unite their minds with him in devotion. The verse emphasizes the importance of divine grace in the journey of knowing God.",
