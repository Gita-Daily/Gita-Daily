This is clearly logical. All souls possess finite intellects, while God is infinite, and hence he is beyond the reach of their intellects. This does not belittle him; rather, it exalts him. The western philosopher F.A. Jacobi stated: \u201cGod whom we could know would be no God.\u201d However in this verse, Arjun states that there is after all one personality who knows God, and that is God himself. Thus, Shree Krishna alone knows himself, and if he decides to grant his powers upon a soul, then that fortunate soul comes to know him as well.\n", "next shlok": 16}
