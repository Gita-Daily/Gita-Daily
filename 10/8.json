    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna begins the verse by saying aha\u1e41 sarvasya prabhavo, meaning \u201cI am the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes.\u201d He has repeated this multiple times in the Bhagavad Gita, in verses 7.7, 7.12, 10.2-3, and 15.15. It is also strongly proclaimed in all the other scriptures. The Rig Veda states:ya\u1e41 k\u0101maye ta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 ugra\u1e41 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47omi ta\u1e41 brahm\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 ta\u1e41 \u1e5bi\u1e63hi\u1e41 ta\u1e41 sumedhsam(10.125.5)[v4]\u201cI make the persons I love exceedingly mighty; I make them men or women; I make them wise sages; I make a soul empowered for the seat of Brahma.\u201d The wise who comprehend this truth develop firm faith and worship him with loving devotion.Thus, Shree Krishna is the Supreme Lord of both the material and spiritual creations. However, administering creation is not the primary work of God. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu states:swaya\u1e41 bhagav\u0101nera karma nahe bh\u0101ra-hara\u1e47a(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela 4.8)[v5]\u201cShree Krishna does not directly involve himself in the works of creating, maintaining, and dissolving the material universes.\u201d Shree Krishna\u2019s primary activity is to engage in eternal loving pastimes with the liberated souls in Golok, his divine abode. For the purpose of material creation, he expands himself as Karanodakshayi Vishnu, who is also called Maha Vishnu.Maha Vishnu is thus the form of the Lord that presides over the material realm, consisting of infinite material universes. Maha Vishnu is also known as Pratham Puru\u1e63h (first expansion of God in the material realm). He resides in the divine water of the k\u0101ra\u1e47 (causal) ocean and manifests innumerable material universes from the pores of his body. He then expands himself to reside at the bottom of each universe as Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, who is called Dwit\u012bya Puru\u1e63h (second expansion of God in the material realm).From Garbhodakshayi Vishnu, Brahma is born. He guides the process of creation\u2014creating the various gross and subtle elements of the universe, the laws of nature, the galaxies and planetary systems, the forms of life residing in them, etc. Hence, Brahma is often referred to as the creator of the universe. However, he is actually the secondary creator.Garbhodakashayi Vishnu further expands himself as Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, and resides at the top of each universe, in a place called K\u1e63h\u012bra S\u0101gar. Kshirodakshayi Vishnu is also known as T\u1e5bit\u012bya Puru\u1e63h (third expansion of God in the material realm). He resides at the top of the universe, but he also resides as the Supreme soul, in the heart of all living beings in the universe, noting their karmas, keeping an account, and giving the results at the appropriate time. He is thus known as the maintainer of the universe.All the three forms of Lord Vishnu mentioned here are non-different from Shree Krishna. Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna states that all spiritual and material creation emanate from him. Shree Krishna is also called the Avat\u0101r\u012b (the source of all the Avat\u0101rs). The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gvatam states: ete ch\u0101\u1e41\u015bha kal\u0101\u1e25 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47as tu bhagav\u0101n svayam (1.3.28)[v6] \u201cAll the forms of God are the expansions, or the expansions of the expansions of Shree Krishna, who is the primordial form of God.\u201d And so, the secondary creator Brahma prays to Shree Krishna:yasyaikani\u015bhvasita k\u0101lamath\u0101valambyaj\u012bvanti lomavilaj\u0101 jagada\u1e47\u1e0dan\u0101th\u0101\u1e25vi\u1e63h\u1e47urmah\u0101n saihayasya kal\u0101vi\u015bhe\u1e63hogovindam\u0101di puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tamaha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 5.48)[v7]\u201cInfinite universes\u2014each having Shankar, Brahma, and Vishnu\u2014manifest from the pores of Maha Vishnu\u2019s body when he breathes in, and again dissolve into him when he breathes out. I worship Shree Krishna of whom Maha Vishnu is an expansion.\u201d Shree Krishna now goes on to explain how devotees worship him.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary of the shloka, Shree Krishna asserts his position as the Supreme Ultimate Truth and the cause of all causes. He clarifies that while he is the Lord of both the material and spiritual realms, his primary activity is engaging in eternal loving pastimes with liberated souls in Golok. For the purpose of material creation, he expands into three forms: Karanodakshayi Vishnu, Maha Vishnu (Pratham Purush), Garbhodakshayi Vishnu (Dwit\u012bya Purush), and Kshirodakshayi Vishnu (Tritiya Purush). These forms are non-different from Shree Krishna himself, and all spiritual and material creations emanate from him. Brahma, the secondary creator, guides the process of creation under the guidance of Garbhodakshayi Vishnu. Shree Krishna is the source of all Avatars and is worshipped by Brahma and other divine beings. The commentary highlights the eternal nature of Shree Krishna's loving relationship with his devotees and his role as the ultimate maintainer of the universe."
