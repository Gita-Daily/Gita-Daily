    "commentary": "\nEarlier Shree Krishna had said that of the Vedas he is the S\u0101ma Veda, which is rich with beautiful devotional songs. Now he says that within the S\u0101ma Veda, he is the Brihatsama, which has an exquisite melody. It is typically sung at midnight.The Sanskrit language, like other languages, has distinctive systems of rhymes and meters for writing poetry. The poetry of the Vedas is in many meters. Amongst these, the Gayatri meter is very attractive and melodious. A famous mantra set in this meter is the Gayatri mantra. It is also a deeply meaningful prayer:bh\u016brbhuva\u1e25 swa\u1e25 tatsaviturvare\u1e47ya\u1e41 bhargo devasya dh\u012bmahi dhiyo yo na\u1e25 prachoday\u0101t (Rig Veda 3.62.10)[v31]\u201cWe meditate upon the Lord who is illuminating the three worlds and is worthy of our worship. He is the remover of all sins and the destroyer of ignorance. May he illumine our intellects in the proper direction.\u201d The Gayatri mantra is a part of the sacred thread ceremony for young males, and is recited as a part of the daily rituals. The Devi Gayatri, the Rudra Gayatri, the Brahma Gayatri, the Paramhansa Gayatri, and several other Gayatri mantras are also found in the Vedas.Margsheersh is the ninth month of the Hindu calendar. It falls in November-December. The temperature at that time in India is just right\u2014neither too hot nor too cold. The crops in the field are harvested at this time of the year. For these reasons it is often the favorite month of the people.Basant (spring season) is known as \u1e5bitu r\u0101ja, or the king of seasons. It is a time when nature seems to be euphorically bursting forth with life. Many festivals are celebrated in spring, epitomizing the joy that pervades the atmosphere. Thus, amongst the seasons, spring manifests God\u2019s opulence the most.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna explains that within the S\u0101ma Veda, he is the Brihatsama, a melody sung at midnight. The Gayatri mantra, set in the Gayatri meter, is a meaningful prayer recited in daily rituals and sacred ceremonies. Other Gayatri mantras like the Devi Gayatri and Brahma Gayatri are also found in the Vedas. The month of Margsheersh in the Hindu calendar, occurring in November-December, is favored due to pleasant temperatures and the harvest of crops. Spring, known as \u1e5bitu r\u0101ja, is a season of abundant life and joy. Numerous spring festivals celebrate the opulence of nature and its manifestation as God."
