    "translation": "\n\nBG 10.33:\r\n                            I am the beginning “A” amongst all letters; I am the dual word in grammatical compounds. I am the endless Time, and amongst creators I am Brahma.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nIn Sanskrit, all letters are formed by combining a half-letter with “a.” For example, क् + अ = क (k + a = ka). Hence, the letter “a” is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. “A” is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, “A” comes at the very beginning.\nAlthough Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is called samāsa, and the resulting word is called samāsa pada, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds of samāsa: 1) dwandva, 2) bahubṛihi, 3) karm dhāray, 4) tatpuruṣh, 5) dwigu, 6) avyayī bhāv. Amongst these, dwandva is the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example of dwandva. Shree Krishna highlights it as his vibhūti.\nCreation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind’s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary discusses the significance of the Sanskrit letter 'a' and its importance in the language. It also explains the concept of compound words in Sanskrit, with a focus on the six types of samāsas. Among these, dwandva is considered the best as it allows both words to remain prominent. The commentary then emphasizes the grandeur of creation and states that even the most advanced human inventions cannot compare to it. Lord Krishna praises Brahma, the first-born creator, for his creative ability, which reflects the glory of God.",
