Hence, the letter \u201ca\u201d is the most important in the Sanskrit alphabet. \u201cA\u201d is also the first vowel of the alphabet, and since the vowels are written before the consonants, \u201cA\u201d comes at the very beginning.\nAlthough Sanskrit is such an ancient language, it is highly refined and sophisticated. A common procedure in Sanskrit language is to combine words to form compound words. When, in the process of making one compound word, two or more words give up their case endings, it is called sam\u0101sa, and the resulting word is called sam\u0101sa pada, or compound word. There are primarily six kinds of sam\u0101sa: 1) dwandva, 2) bahub\u1e5bihi, 3) karm dh\u0101ray, 4) tatpuru\u1e63h, 5) dwigu, 6) avyay\u012b bh\u0101v. Amongst these, dwandva is the best because both words remain prominent in it, while in the others, either one word becomes more prominent, or both words combine together to give the meaning of a third word. The dual word Radha-Krishna is an example of dwandva. Shree Krishna highlights it as his vibh\u016bti.\nCreation is a magnificent act and awesome to behold. Humankind\u2019s most sophisticated and technologically advanced inventions pale in comparison. Therefore, Lord Krishna singles out the first-born Brahma, who made the entire universe, and says that amongst creators, the creative ability of Brahma best reflects the glory of God.\n", "next shlok": 34}
