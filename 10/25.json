    "commentary": "\nWhile all fruits and flowers grow from the same land, only the best amongst them are selected for an exhibition. Similarly, everything that is manifest and unmanifest in the universe is the glory of God, but the prominent amongst them are singled out for mention as his opulence.Amongst the sages in the celestial planes of existence, Bhrigu is special. He possesses wisdom, glory, and devotion. Lord Vishnu holds the mark of his foot on his chest as a consequence of a divine pastime described in the Puranas in which Bhrigu tested the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiv. Shree Krishna\u2019s glory is revealed best through him.Worshippers of God in his formless aspect like to meditate on the \u201cOm\u201d vibration, which is another vibh\u016bti of God. Shree Krishna had declared previously, in verses 7.8 and 8.13, the syllable \u201cOm\u201d to be a sacred sound. It is the an\u0101hat n\u0101d (the sound vibration that pervades creation). It is often present in the beginning of Vedic mantras for invoking auspiciousness. It is said that from the mono-syllable \u201cOm\u201d the Gayatri mantra was revealed, and from the Gayatri mantra, the Vedas were revealed.The Himalayas are a mountain range lying at the north of India. Since ages, they have inspired spiritual awe and wonder in billions of devotees. Their atmosphere, environment, and solitude are conducive to the performance of austerities for spiritual progress. Thus, many great sages reside in the Himalayas in their subtle bodies, practicing penance for their own advancement and for the benefit of humankind. And so, of the multitude of mountain ranges in this world, the Himalayas best display his opulence.Yaj\u00f1a is the act of dedicating ourselves to the Supreme. The simplest of all yaj\u00f1as is the chanting of the holy names of God. This is called japa yaj\u00f1a, or the sacrifice of the devotional repetition of the divine names of God. For the practice of ritualistic yaj\u00f1as, a number of rules are applicable, all of which need to be meticulously followed. However, in japa yaj\u00f1a, there are no rules. It can be done anywhere and at any time, and is more purifying than the other forms of yaj\u00f1as. In the present age of Kali, the chanting of the names of God is even more emphasized.kalijuga kevala n\u0101ma \u0101dh\u0101r\u0101, sumiri sumiri nara utarahi\u1e45 p\u0101r\u0101 (Ramayan)[v28]\u201cIn the age of Kali, the chanting and remembrance of the names of God is the most powerful means of crossing the ocean of material existence.\u201d\n",

Lord Vishnu bears the mark of Bhrigu's foot on his chest as a result of a pastime. The significance of the 'Om' vibration as a sacred sound and its connection to the Gayatri mantra and Vedas is explained. The Himalayas, known for their spiritual aura, are seen as displaying God's opulence through their conducive environment for spiritual practices. The act of dedicating oneself to the Supreme, known as Yaj\u00f1a, is simplified to chanting the holy names of God, which is considered more purifying than other forms of Yaj\u00f1a. In the present age, the chanting and remembrance of God's names is emphasized as a potent means to transcend material existence.",
