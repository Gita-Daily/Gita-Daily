Since it expands by sending down aerial roots, it is huge and provides cooling shade in a large area. The Buddha meditated and attained enlightenment under a peepal tree (sacred fig tree).The celestial sage Narad is the Guru of many great personalities such as Ved Vyas, Valmiki, Dhruv, and Prahlad. He is always engaged in singing the glories of God and doing divine works throughout the three worlds. He is also famous for deliberately creating quarrels and problems, and people sometimes misunderstand him to be a mischief-maker. However, it is his desire to purify famous personalities that makes him create quarrels around them, which ultimately result in self-introspection and purification.The Gandharva planet is inhabited by beings who sing beautifully, and amongst them the best singer is Chitrarath. The siddhas are yogis who have spiritual perfection. Amongst these, Sage Kapil revealed the S\u0101nkhya system of philosophy and also taught the glories of bhakti yog (described in detail in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, third canto). He was an Avat\u0101r of God and thus Shree Krishna makes special mention of him as a manifestation of his glory.\n", "next shlok": 27}
