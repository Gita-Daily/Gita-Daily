From his first wife, Aditi, he fathered twelve celestial personalities\u2014Dhata, Mitra, Aryama, Shakra, Varun, Amsha, Bhaga, Vivasvan, Pusha, Savita, Twashta, and Vaman. Amongst these, Vaman was the Avatar of the Supreme Lord Vishnu. Thus, Shree Krishna states that amongst the Adityas (twelve sons of Aditi), Vishnu (in the form of Vaman) reveals his opulence.Amongst luminous objects, the sun is supreme. The Ramayan states:r\u0101k\u0101pati \u1e63ho\u1e5basa uahi\u00f1 t\u0101r\u0101gana samud\u0101i,sakala girinha dava l\u0101ia binu rabi r\u0101ti na j\u0101i [v26]\u201cAt night, all the lamps along with all the stars in the sky and the moon as well are together insufficient in removing the darkness of the night. But the moment the sun rises, the night gets dispelled.\u201d That is the power of the sun, which Shree Krishna reveals as his vibh\u016bti.Then, he comes to the night sky. There is the well-known saying, \u201cOne moon is better than a thousand stars.\u201d Shree Krishna says that amongst all the constellations and stars in the night sky, he is the moon because it best reveals his opulence.The Puranas further relate that Sage Kashyap fathered daityas (demons) from his second wife Diti. However, apart from the daityas, Diti desired to have a son more powerful than Indra (the king of the celestial gods). So she kept her baby in her womb for a year. Indra then used a thunderbolt and split her fetus into many pieces, but it turned into many fetuses. These became the maruts, or the 49 kinds of winds that flow in the universe, doing tremendous good. The major ones amongst them are Avaha, Pravaha, Nivaha, Purvaha, Udvaha, Samvaha, and Parivaha. The chief wind, known as Parivaha, also bears the name Marichi. Shree Krishna states that his vibh\u016bti (opulence) manifests in the wind called \u201cMarichi.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 22}
