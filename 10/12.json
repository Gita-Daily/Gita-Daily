    "commentary": "\nCommentators on the Vedic scriptures are sometimes fond of saying that Shree Krishna, Shree Ram etc. are not the Supreme Entity. They claim that the Ultimate Reality is formless and without attributes it takes on forms and manifests as Avat\u0101rs, and thus these Avat\u0101rs are a step removed from God. However, Arjun refutes such viewpoints by declaring that Shree Krishna in his personal form is the supreme cause of all causes.Upon hearing the previous four verses, Arjun is convinced entirely about the supreme position of Shree Krishna, and emphatically vents the deep conviction that he now feels within himself. When great authorities testify knowledge, its credibility gets established. The great saints are the authorities for spiritual knowledge. Thus, Arjun quotes the saints, such as Narad, Asit, Deval, and Vyas, who have proclaimed Shree Krishna as the Supreme Divine Personality and the cause of all causes. In the Bheeshma Parva of the Mahabharat, there is a poem in which many sages eulogize Shree Krishna. Sage Narad says: \u201cShree Krishna is the creator of all the worlds and the knower of all feelings. He is the Lord of the celestial gods, who administer the universe.\u201d (Verse 68.2) Sage Markandeya states: \u201cLord Krishna is the goal of all religious sacrifices and the essence of austerities. He is the present, past, and future of everything.\u201d (Verse 68.3) Sage Bhrigu says: \u201cHe is the God of gods and the first original form of Lord Vishnu.\u201d (Verse 68.4) Sage Ved Vyas states: \u201cO Lord Krishna, You are the Lord of the Vasus. You have conferred power on Indra and the other celestial gods.\u201d (Verse 68.5) Sage Angira says: \u201cLord Krishna is the creator of all beings. All the three worlds exist in his stomach. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\u201d (Verse 68.6) Elsewhere in the Mahabharat, Sage Asit and Deval declare: \u201cShree Krishna is the creator of Brahma, who is the creator of the three worlds.\u201d (Mahabharat Vana Parva 12.50) Quoting these great authorities, Arjun says that now Shree Krishna is himself reconfirming their statements by declaring that he is the supreme cause of all creation.\n",
