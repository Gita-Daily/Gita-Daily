From verses 20 to 39, he has described 82 of his infinite opulences. He now says that he has spoken only one portion (udde\u015bhata\u1e25) of the breadth of the topic (vist\u0101ra\u1e25).The question can be asked that if everything is the opulence of God, then what was the need of mentioning these? The answer is that Arjun had asked Shree Krishna how he should think of him, and these glories have been described in response to Arjun\u2019s question. The mind is naturally drawn to specialties, and thus, the Lord has revealed these specialties amongst his powers. Whenever we see a special splendor manifesting anywhere, if we look on it as God\u2019s glory, then our mind will naturally be transported to him. In the larger scheme of things, however, since God\u2019s glories are in all things big and small, one can think of the whole world as providing innumerable examples for enhancing our devotion. A paint company in India would advertise, \u201cWhenever you see colors think of us.\u201d In this case, Shree Krishna\u2019s statement is tantamount to saying, \u201cWherever you see a manifestation of glory, think of me.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 41}
