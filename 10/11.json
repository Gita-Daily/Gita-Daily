    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna further elaborates the concept of grace. Previously, he had explained that he bestows it upon those who lovingly absorb their minds in him and make him the paramount object of their plans, thoughts, and activities. Now, he reveals what happens when someone receives his grace. He says that he destroys the darkness in their heart with the lamp of wisdom.\nIgnorance is often symbolized as darkness, but what is this lamp of wisdom that God talks about? At present, our senses, mind, and intellect are all material, while God is divine. Hence, we are unable to see him, hear him, know him, or be united with him. When God bestows his grace, he confers his divine Yogmaya energy upon the soul. It is also called \u015bhuddha sattva (divine mode of goodness), which is distinct from the sattva gu\u1e47a (mode of goodness) of Maya. When we receive that \u015bhuddha sattva energy, our sense, mind, and intellect become divine. To put it simply, by his grace, God bestows his divine senses, divine mind, and divine intellect to the soul. Equipped with these divine instruments, the soul is able to see God, hear God, know God, and be united with God. Hence, the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan states: vi\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101nugraha\u015bh cha (3.4.38)[v13] \u201cOnly by God\u2019s grace does one gain divine knowledge.\u201d In this way, the torchlight that Shree Krishna refers to is his divine power. By the light of God\u2019s divine power the darkness of the material energy is dispelled.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains the concept of grace and its effects on the recipient. He states that his grace destroys the darkness in the heart with the lamp of wisdom. The lamp of wisdom is the divine energy bestowed upon the soul when it receives God's grace. This divine energy, called \u015bhuddha sattva, transforms the material senses, mind, and intellect into divine ones. With these divine instruments, the soul is able to see, hear, know, and be united with God. The Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan states that divine knowledge can only be attained through God's grace. Thus, the torchlight mentioned by Shree Krishna symbolizes God's divine power, which dispels the darkness of material energy.",
