Now, he states the same for all creation, \u201cAll that is created, such as space, air, fire, water, and earth, is called sarga. I am the Creator (\u0101di), Maintainer (madhya), and Annihilator (anta) of these. Therefore, the processes of creation, maintenance, and dissolution can be meditated upon as my vibh\u016btis.\u201dVidy\u0101 is the education that a person acquires in relation to subjects of knowledge. The scriptures describe eighteen types of vidy\u0101s. Amongst them, fourteen are prominent:a\u1e45g\u0101ni ved\u0101\u015bhchatv\u0101ro m\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101 ny\u0101ya vistara\u1e25 pur\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 dharma\u015bh\u0101stra\u1e41 cha vidy\u0101 hyet\u0101\u015bhchaturda\u015bha\u0101yurvedo dhanurvedo g\u0101ndharva\u015bhchaiva te traya\u1e25artha\u015bh\u0101stra\u1e41 chaturtha\u1e41 tu vidy\u0101 hya\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101da\u015bhaiva t\u0101\u1e25(Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47 3.6.27-28)[v29]\u201c\u015ahik\u015bh\u0101, Kalp, Vy\u0101kara\u1e47, Nirukti, Jyoti\u1e63h, Chhanda\u2014these are the six types of knowledge known as Ved\u0101\u1e45g (limbs of the Vedas). \u1e5aig, Yajur, S\u0101ma, Atharva\u2014these are the four branches of Vedic knowledge. Along with M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, Ny\u0101ya, Dharma \u015ah\u0101stra, and the Puranas, these comprise the fourteen chief vidy\u0101s.\u201d Practice of these vidy\u0101s cultivates the intellect, deepens the knowledge, and increases awareness of the path of dharma. Additionally, the science of spirituality liberates human beings from material bondage and gives them immortality. Thus, it is superior to the previously mentioned vidy\u0101s. This is mentioned in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam as well: s\u0101 vidy\u0101 tanmatiryay\u0101 (Verse 4.29.49)[v30] \u201cThe best knowledge is that by which the intellect becomes attached to the lotus feet of God.\u201dIn the field of argument and logic, jalpa means to find fault with the opponent\u2019s statements, for the sake of establishing one\u2019s own opinion. Vita\u1e47\u1e0da means to avoid proper deliberation on the truth through evasion and frivolous arguments. V\u0101da is the logical conclusion of the discussion. Logic is the basis for communication of ideas and establishment of truths. It is because of a universal sense of logic that knowledge can be easily cultivated, taught, and learnt in human society. The universal principles of logic are a manifestation of the power of God.\n", "next shlok": 33}
