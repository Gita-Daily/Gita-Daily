However, in the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, verse 11.16.22, Shree Krishna states that amongst the priests he is Vashishtha. Why is he differing in the two places? This implies that we should not attach importance to the object, but to the opulence of God that manifests in that object. All the objects of glory that Shree Krishna is describing here should also be understood in the same light. It is not the object that is being emphasized, rather God\u2019s opulence that is manifesting in it.Kartikeya, the son of Lord Shiv, who is also called Skanda, is the commander-in-chief of the celestial gods. He is thus the chief of all military commanders, and best reflects the opulence of God. Shree Krishna further says that amongst stagnant bodies of water, he is the grave and mighty ocean.\n",
