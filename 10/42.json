    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna\u2019s statement indicates that he has already answered the question. Now, of his own accord, he wants to tell something remarkable. Having revealed many amazing aspects of his splendor, he says that the magnitude of his glory cannot be judged even from the sum total of what he has described, for the entire creation of unlimited universes is held within a fraction of his being.Why does he make a reference to a fraction of his being here? The reason is that the entire material creation consisting of unlimited universes is only one-fourth of God\u2019s entire manifestation; the remaining three-fourths is the spiritual creation.p\u0101do \u2019sya vi\u015bhw\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni trip\u0101dasy\u0101m\u1e5bita\u1e41 divi (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam Mantra 3)[v32]\u201cThis temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of the Supreme Divine Personality. The other three parts are his eternal abodes that are beyond the phenomenon of life and death.\u201dInterestingly, Shree Krishna is in front of Arjun, within the world, yet he reveals that the entire world is within a fraction of his being. This is like the story of Ganesh and Lord Shiv. Once, Sage Narad gave Lord Shiv a very special fruit. Lord Shiv\u2019s two children, Kartikeya and Ganesh both began demanding the fruit from him. Lord Shiv thought that if he would give it to any one of them, the other would think that their father was biased. So Lord Shiv announced a competition for his two children. Whoever circumambulated the entire universe and came back to him first would get the fruit.On hearing this, Kartikeya immediately started off to circumambulate the universe. He was athletically and powerfully built and decided to take advantage of it. In comparison, Ganesh had a plump body and felt he was handicapped in competing with his brother. So, Ganesh decided to make up for it by using his intellect. Lord Shiv and Parvati were standing there. Ganesh circumambulated them thrice, and then announced, \u201cFather, I have done it. Please give me the fruit.\u201d Lord Shiv, \u201cBut how have you gone around the universe? You have been with us all the while.\u201d Ganesh said, \u201cFather, you are God. The entire universe exists within you. If I have gone around you, I have gone around the entire universe.\u201d Lord Shiv had to agree that his son Ganesh was very smart, and indeed he had won the competition.Just as Lord Shiv was standing in one place, and yet the entire world was contained in him, similarly, Shree Krishna announces to Arjun that the entire creation, consisting of unlimited material universes, is held within a fraction of his being.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that Shree Krishna has already answered the question asked. He now wants to share something remarkable. Shree Krishna reveals that the magnitude of his glory cannot be comprehended, as even the sum total of his description only represents a fraction of his being. This is because the material creation, consisting of unlimited universes, is just one-fourth of God's entire manifestation, while the remaining three-fourths constitute the spiritual creation. Shree Krishna uses the analogy of Ganesh and Lord Shiv to illustrate this concept. Ganesh circumambulates his parents, Lord Shiv and Parvati, and claims to have gone around the entire universe because he considers them to be the embodiment of the universe. Similarly, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that the entire creation exists within a fraction of his being. This commentary emphasizes the vastness and transcendental nature of Shree Krishna's being and highlights the limited understanding of human perception.",
