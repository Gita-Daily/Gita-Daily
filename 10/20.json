    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna declares that he is not far from the soul\u2014in fact he is closer than the closest. The \u0101tm\u0101 or eternal soul is enthroned in the etheric heart of all living beings. The Vedas state: ya \u0101tmani ti\u1e63h\u1e6dhati [v21] \u201cGod is seated within our soul.\u201d Seated inside, he grants the power of consciousness and eternality to the soul. If he were to subtract his power, our soul itself would become insentient and perish. We souls are thus eternal and sentient, not by our own power, but because the supremely sentient and eternal God is seated within, and is granting his powers to us. Hence, Shree Krishna declares that he is situated in the heart of all living beings.Our soul is the body of God, who is the Soul of our soul. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:harirhi s\u0101k\u1e63h\u0101dbhagav\u0101n \u015bhar\u012bri\u1e47\u0101m\u0101tm\u0101 jha\u1e63h\u0101\u1e47\u0101miva toyam\u012bpsitam(5.18.13)[v22]\u201cGod is the \u0101tm\u0101 of the \u0101tm\u0101 (Soul of the soul) of all living beings.\u201d In the Bh\u0101gavatam again, when Shukadev described how the gop\u012bs used to leave their own children to go and see baby Shree Krishna, Parikshit asked him how this was possible:brahman parodbhave k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47e iy\u0101n prem\u0101 katha\u1e41 bhavet(10.14.49)[v23]\u201cO Brahmin, all mothers are attached to their own children. How did the gop\u012bs develop such intense attachment to Shree Krishna, which they did not even feel toward their own child?\u201d Shukadev replied:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47amenamavehi tvam\u0101tm\u0101namakhil\u0101tman\u0101m(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.14.55)[v24]\u201cPlease understand that Lord Krishna is the Supreme Soul of all living beings in the universe. For the benefit of humankind, he has appeared in a human form by his Yogmaya power.\u201dShree Krishna further states that he is the beginning, middle, and end of all living beings. They have emanated from him, and so he is their beginning. All life that exists in creation is sustained by his energy, and so he is the middle. And those who attain liberation go to his divine abode to live eternally with him. Hence, God is also the end of all living beings. Amongst the various definitions of God given by the Vedas, one of them is:yato v\u0101 im\u0101ni bh\u016bt\u0101ni j\u0101yante yena j\u0101t\u0101ni j\u012bvanti, yatprayantyabhisa\u1e41vi\u015bhanti(Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had 3.1.1)[v25]\u201cGod is he from whom all living beings have emanated; God is he within whom all living beings are situated; God is he into whom all living beings shall unite.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna reveals that he is not distant from the soul but rather closer than the closest. He resides within the eternal soul and grants consciousness and eternal power to it. Without his presence, the soul would become lifeless. Our souls are eternal and sentient because of the divine power bestowed upon us by God, who is situated in the heart of all living beings. The Bhagavatam confirms that God is the soul of our soul, the essence of all living beings. Shree Krishna explains that he is the source, sustainer, and ultimate destination of all life. All beings originate from him, are sustained by his energy, and those who attain liberation merge with him in his divine abode. This comprehensive perspective is supported by the Vedas, which describe God as the creator, sustainer, and ultimate reuniter of all living beings.",
