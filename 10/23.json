    "newest_commentary": "The commentary describes the forms of Lord Shiv known as the rudras, including Shankar. The yakshas, led by Kuber, are worshippers of wealth. The vasus represent the elements of the universe, with agni being highlighted by Shree Krishna. Meru is a mountain known for its resources and is mentioned as a manifestation of Shree Krishna's glory. Just as wealth distinguishes a wealthy person, these glories reveal the vibh\u016btis of God."
