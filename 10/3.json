Is he contradicting himself? No, he means that by self-efforts no one can know God, but if God himself bestows his grace upon someone, that fortunate soul gets to know him. Hence, all those who come to know God do so by virtue of his divine grace. As he mentions in verse 10 of this chapter: \u201cTo those whose minds are always united with me in loving devotion, I give the divine knowledge by which they can attain me.\u201d Here, Shree Krishna says that those who know him as the Supreme Lord of all lords are not deluded. Such blessed souls become free from all reactions to their past and present actions, and develop loving devotion toward him.To make the distinction between the souls and himself, Shree Krishna declares that he is loka mahe\u015bhwaram (the great Lord of all the abodes of existence).
