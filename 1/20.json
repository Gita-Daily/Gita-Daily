Seeing your sons arrayed against him, O King, Arjun then spoke the following words to Shree Krishna.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nHere Sanjay addresses Arjun by another name, \u201cKapi Dhwaj,\u201d which means \u201cMonkey Bannered.\u201d This denotes the presence of the mighty Monkey God; Hanuman on Arjun\u2019s chariot. It so happened that, once Arjun became very boastful of his archery skills and quipped at Shree Krishna. He said, \u201cI do not understand why during Lord Rama\u2019s time, the monkeys worked so hard to make a bridge from India to Lanka with heavy stones? If I was there, I would have made a bridge of arrows.\u201d The Omniscient Lord asked him, \u201cAlright, go ahead show me your bridge.\u201d \u00a0Very skillfully Arjun showered thousands of arrows and made a huge bridge. Now, it was time to test it. Shree Krishna called upon great Hanuman for the job. As soon as Hanuman started walking on the bridge, it started crumbling under his feet. Arjun realized his folly; his bridge of arrows could not have upheld the weight of Lord Rama\u2019s huge army. He asked for their forgiveness. Subsequently, Hanuman gave Arjun lessons on being humble and never be proud of his skills. He also granted Arjun a boon that, during the great war, he would seat himself on Arjun\u2019s chariot. Therefore, Arjun\u2019s chariot flag carried the insignia of the great Hanuman.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Sanjay addresses Arjun by the name 'Kapi Dhwaj' meaning 'Monkey Bannered' due to the presence of Hanuman on Arjun's chariot. Arjun once boasted about his archery skills, comparing them to Lord Rama's monkey army building a bridge to Lanka. In response, Krishna challenged Arjun to build a bridge of arrows. Arjun succeeded but realized his bridge couldn't support Lord Rama's army. Hanuman taught Arjun humility and granted him the boon of being on his chariot during the war. As a result, Arjun's chariot carried the insignia of Hanuman as a reminder of the lesson learned.",
