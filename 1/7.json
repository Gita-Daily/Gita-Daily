    "commentary": "\nDronacharya was a teacher of military science and not really a warrior. However, he was on the battlefield as one of the commanders of the Kaurava army. An impudent Duryodhana even doubted the loyalty of his own preceptor. Cunning Duryodhana purposefully addressed his teacher as dwijottama (best amongst the twice-born, or Brahmins). His denigrating and vailed reminder for Dronacharya was that, if he did not display his valor in this battle, he would be considered a lowly Brahmin, who was only interested in the fine food and lavish lifestyle at the king\u2019s palace.Then to cover up his vicious words and boost his teacher\u2019s and his own morale; Duryodhana started naming all the great generals present on the Kaurava side, describing their valor and military expertise.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Dronacharya, a teacher of military science, faced doubt from his student Duryodhana on the battlefield. Duryodhana questioned his loyalty and demeaned him as a mere Brahmin. To motivate Dronacharya, Duryodhana praised the other great generals on the Kaurava side. This commentary highlights Dronacharya's position as a commander despite his primary role as a teacher. It also reveals Duryodhana's cunning nature and his attempt to manipulate his teacher's actions. The commentary explores the complexities of loyalty, identity, and social hierarchy within the context of the epic battle in the Bhagavad Gita."
