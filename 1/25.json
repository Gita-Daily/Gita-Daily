    "newest_commentary": "In the commentary, Shree Krishna addresses Arjun as 'Parth' and reminds him of his lineage. He points out that both the Kauravas and Pandavas are descendants of the great king Kuru, making them all family and relatives. This revelation plants the seed of delusion in Arjun's mind, setting the stage for the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Shree Krishna's deliberate choice of words aims to eliminate the delusion later and prepare for the gospel he is about to preach. The Bhagavad Gita is seen as a beneficial guide for future generations in the age of Kali."
