Duryodhana was subtly reminding his teacher of a mistake he had committed in the past.Many years back, Dronacharya along with the Pandavas had defeated King Drupad in a battle and took away half his kingdom. To avenge his defeat, Drupad performed a sacrifice to beget a son. Dhristadyumna was born out of that sacrificial fire, with a boon that he would kill Dronacharya in the future. Even though Dronacharya was aware, when he was approached for Dhristadyumna\u2019s military training, he very humbly accepted and imparted all his knowledge impartially to his pupil.Duryodhana was reminding Dronacharya that even though Dhristadyumna was his pupil, he was also Drupad\u2019s son, with a boon to kill him. He wanted to ensure that as in the past, Dhronacharya should not become lenient towards his pupils, now that, they were on the battlefield.\n", "next shlok": 4}
