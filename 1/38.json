    "commentary": "\nArjun was a proclaimed warrior, but due to his righteous nature, he tried to avoid violence whenever possible. This side of his character is well revealed in an incident that took place towards the end of the Mahabharat war.Duryodhana was badly injured, and only a handful of warriors were remaining on the Kaurava side. Ashwatthama was one of them. He wanted to avenge his father Dronacharaya and his friends Kauravas' death. He sneaked into the Pandava camp at night while everyone was fast asleep and\u00a0went on\u00a0a carnage. Several warriors including Draupadi\u2019s five sons were killed in this attack. The Pandavas, along with Draupadi and Shree Krishna were away that night. When they returned to the camp, they were devasted. Arjun went after Ashwatthama, caught him and threw him at the feet of Draupadi, who was grieving the death of her young sons. Bheem was raged and wanted to kill Ashwatthama right way, but Draupadi was a soft-hearted lady of forgiving nature. She said that Ashwatthama was their Guru Drona\u2019s son and a Brahmin, therefore, they should forgive him. Arjun was unsure what to do next and wanted guidance from Shree Krishna, who then said, \u201cA respect-worthy Brahmin must be forgiven even if he may have temporarily fallen from virtue.\u00a0 But a person who approaches to kill with a lethal weapon must certainly be punished.\u201d\u00a0 Arjun understood what the Lord meant; he did not kill Ashwatthama. Instead, he cut his brahmin\u2019s tuft, removed the jewel of immense power from his forehead, and let him go.\u1e5bitvikpurohit\u0101ch\u0101ryair m\u0101tul\u0101tithisan\u015bhritai\u1e25b\u0101lav\u1e5biddh\u0101turair vaidyair j\u00f1\u0101tisam bandhib\u0101ndhavai\u1e25(Manu Sm\u1e5biti 4.179)\u201cOne should not squabble with, the Brahmin who performs the fire sacrifice, the family priest, teacher, maternal uncle, guest, dependent children, elders, doctor or relatives.\u201d\u00a0Arjun was aware that killing one\u2019s own relatives was a great sin. He said to Shree Krishna, \u201cGreed has blinded them (Kauravas) and they do not realize that it is a great sin to kill their own relatives and friends, but why should we do the same thing, when we can avoid this transgression?\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "Arjun, known for his righteous nature, tried to avoid violence but faced a dilemma when Ashwatthama killed many warriors, including Draupadi\u2019s sons. Arjun captured Ashwatthama and brought him to Draupadi. Bheem wanted to kill him, but Draupadi advocated for forgiveness as he was a Brahmin and the son of their Guru Drona. Arjun sought guidance from Shree Krishna, who stated that a Brahmin must be forgiven, but someone who intends to kill should be punished. Understanding the Lord's message, Arjun spared Ashwatthama's life but removed his powers. Arjun's decision was influenced by his knowledge of the scriptures, which emphasized not quarrelling with religious leaders or killing one's relatives. Arjun believed that avoiding such transgressions was essential, even when the Kauravas themselves had succumbed to greed and ignored their moral obligations.",
