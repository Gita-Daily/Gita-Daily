    "commentary": "\nArjun was surprised; despite being aware that this war would only bring misfortune to all, those who were in the battlefield and the families they would leave behind; they were all hankering to commit this sin. He started with the word \u201caho,\u201d which means \u2018alas\u2019. He had enumerated all the possible catastrophes that were imminent if this war took place, but he was ignoring the very fact that if the wrongdoers were not punished, it would cause greater damage to the society.Often, we keep blaming the circumstances or others but turn a blind eye towards our own weaknesses. Arjun\u2019s justification for not killing his greedy cousins and relatives was driven by his own attachment and compassion towards them. Even though he felt it was a sin to kill them, as they were his relatives, he did not realize that his sentiments were actually materialistic and not transcendental. Blinded by compassion, he had forgotten his dharma as a warrior; that he was beyond this material body. His delusion had come to a point where he was willing to drop his weapons and allow his enemy to kill him unarmed.\n",

Despite enumerating the potential catastrophes, he failed to see that not punishing wrongdoers would damage society further. We often blame circumstances and others without acknowledging our own weaknesses. Arjun's reluctance to kill his greedy relatives was driven by attachment and misguided compassion. He failed to realize that his sentiments were materialistic, not transcendental. Blinded by compassion, he forgot his duty as a warrior and his true nature beyond the material body. He was willing to drop his weapons and allow his enemy to kill him unarmed."
