    "newest_commentary": "The commentary describes the scene where the Kaurava army's uproar was fading, and Lord Krishna and Arjuna from the Pandava side blew their conch shells, inspiring their army. The term 'Madhav' is used to refer to Lord Krishna, indicating that the goddess of prosperity, Lakshmi, was with the Pandavas, assuring their victory and the retrieval of their kingdom. Arjuna, the third Pandava brother, was a formidable warrior with exceptional archery skills and a chariot gifted by Agni, the god of fire."
