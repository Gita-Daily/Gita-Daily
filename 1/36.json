    "translation": "\n\nBG 1.36-37:\r\n                            O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them. Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?\n\n",
    "commentary": "\nSimilar to the previous verses, Arjun continues to explicate his unwillingness to kill his relatives by using the words \u201ceven though\u201d again. Addressing Shree Krishna as Janardhana, sustainer of the populace, he said, \u201cEven though I am aware that they are willing to attack us, I feel it would be a sin to kill my uncle Dhritarashtra\u2019s sons.\u201dThen addressing him as Madhav, Goddess Lakshmi\u2019s husband, Arjun said, \u201cIt is not proper on our part to kill our cousins and relatives, how can we ever be happy by doing such a deed?\u201dUnder most circumstances killing or taking someone\u2019s life is considered a grave sin, which subsequently causes guilt and repentance. \u00a0\u00a0The Vedas state: m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarv\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni \u201cDo not kill any living being.\u201d Unless absolutely necessary in an extreme situation, violence in any form is a sin and non-violence a superior virtue. In Arjun\u2019s case, even though the enemy\u2019s wrong deeds were unpardonable, he was not willing to kill them considering it to be immoral. \u00a0However, according to Vasi\u1e63h\u1e6dh Sm\u1e5biti (verse 3.19) under six circumstances it is acceptable to kill; in order to protect themselves from such enemies who have: set fire to their property, tried to poison them, conspired to murder, loot their wealth, kidnap or dishonor their women, or seize their kingdom.\u00a0 Even the Manu Sm\u1e5biti (8.351) mentions that it is not considered a sin if someone kills an attacker in self-defense.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Arjuna expresses his unwillingness to kill his own relatives, referring to Krishna as Janardhana and Madhav. He believes it is a sin to kill his uncle Dhritarashtra's sons, despite their willingness to attack. Violence is generally considered a grave sin, as stated in the Vedas. Non-violence is seen as a superior virtue, except in extreme situations. Arjuna, even though aware of the enemy's wrong deeds, hesitates to kill them due to moral reasons. However, certain circumstances, such as self-defense against attackers who have harmed them or their property, are exceptions. According to Vasi\u1e63h\u1e6dh Sm\u1e5biti and Manu Sm\u1e5biti, killing in self-defense is not considered a sin."
