Even though Arjun\u2019s thoughts were moral and virtuous, they were not spiritual sentiments. They were budding out of compassion and attachment towards his relatives.

    "newest_commentary": "The commentary explains that killing someone, especially a relative, is immoral and sinful. Arjun is conflicted because winning through such an act would bring him no joy as he would lose the people who matter to him. While detachment from worldly possessions is commendable, Arjun's thoughts are driven by compassion and attachment. Spiritual sentiments, which bring peace and happiness, are lacking in his dilemma. Arjun is disillusioned, confused, and losing control over his body and mind."
