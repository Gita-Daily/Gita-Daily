Everyone follows My path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.\u201d\u00a0 Here, Shree Krishna confirms that the worshippers of the formless also reach Him.\u00a0 Since their choice is to unite with the attributeless manifestation of the Supreme Absolute Truth, God meets them as the unmanifest, all-pervading Brahman.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Shree Krishna emphasizes that while worship of the personal form is ideal, He does not reject worship of the formless. Devotion to the infinite, unmanifest Brahman also leads to attaining God. Living beings possess diverse natures, and God too has infinite aspects to His personality. To aid our understanding, Ved Vyas classified God's manifestations into Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n. It is important, however, not to claim one's conception as the only correct one. Shree Krishna reiterates that He reciprocates with all forms of surrender, knowingly or unknowingly. The worshippers of the formless unite with the attributeless manifestation of God, the all-pervading Brahman.",
    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that worship of both the personal and formless forms of God is acceptable. Devotion to the infinite, unmanifest Brahman also leads to attaining God. God has infinite aspects to His personality, classified as Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n. It is important not to claim one's conception as the only correct one. Shree Krishna reciprocates with all forms of surrender, whether known or unknowing. The worshippers of the formless unite with the all-pervading Brahman."
