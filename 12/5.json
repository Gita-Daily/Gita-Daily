    "commentary": "\nHaving embraced worshippers of all His various manifestations into the fold, Shree Krishna again reiterates His preference for the worship of the personal form.\u00a0 He surmises the worship of the impersonal Brahman by saying that it is an exceedingly challenging path that is full of tribulations.Why is the worship of the formless Brahman so difficult?\u00a0 The first and foremost reason for this is that we humans possess a form ourselves and we have been habituated to interacting with forms in endless lifetimes.\u00a0 Thus, while striving to love God as well, if our mind has a wonderful enchanting form to meditate upon, it can easily focus upon it and increase its attachment to the Lord.\u00a0 However, in the case of the formless, the intellect cannot conceive of it, and the mind and senses have no tangible object to relate to.\u00a0 So both the endeavors of meditating on God and increasing the mind\u2019s attachment to Him become difficult.Worship of Brahman is also difficult in comparison to that of Bhagav\u0101n for another reason. \u00a0The difference in paths can be understood through the marka\u1e6d-ki\u015bhore ny\u0101ya (the logic of the baby) monkey, and m\u0101rj\u0101r-ki\u015bhore ny\u0101ya (the logic of the baby kitten).\u00a0 The baby monkey is responsible for holding onto her mother\u2019s stomach; it is not helped by its mother.\u00a0 When the mother monkey jumps from one branch to another, the onus of clinging tightly onto the mother is upon the baby, and if it is unable to do so, it falls.\u00a0 In contrast, a kitten is very small and delicate, but the mother takes the responsibility of transporting it from one place to another, by holding the kitten from behind the neck and lifting it up.\u00a0 In the analogy, the devotees of the formless can be compared to the baby monkey and the devotees of the personal form can be compared to the baby kitten.\u00a0 Those who worship the formless Brahman have the onus of progressing on the path by themselves, because Brahman does not bestow grace upon them.\u00a0 Brahman is not only formless, It is also without attributes.\u00a0 It has been described as nirgu\u1e47a (without qualities), nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63h (without attributes), and nir\u0101k\u0101r (without form).\u00a0 From this, it follows that Brahman does not manifest the quality of grace.\u00a0 The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who worship God as nirgu\u1e47a, nirvi\u015bhe\u1e63h, and nir\u0101k\u0101r, have to rely entirely upon self-effort for progress.\u00a0 On the other hand, the personal form of God is an ocean of compassion and mercy.\u00a0 Hence, devotees of the personal form receive the help of divine support in their s\u0101dhan\u0101.\u00a0 On the basis of the protection that God bestows upon His devotees, Shree Krishna stated in verse 9.31: \u201cO son of Kunti, declare it boldly that no devotee of Mine is ever lost.\u201d\u00a0 He confirms the same statement in the next two verses.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna emphasizes the worship of the personal form over the impersonal Brahman. He explains that humans are accustomed to interacting with forms and find it easier to meditate on a beautiful form in their devotion to God. In contrast, the formless Brahman is difficult to comprehend as the intellect, mind, and senses lack a tangible object to relate to. Worship of Brahman requires self-effort and does not receive divine grace. On the other hand, the personal form of God is filled with compassion and mercy, providing support to devotees in their spiritual practice. Shree Krishna reassures that no devotee of His is ever lost, emphasizing the protection and care provided by the personal form of God.",
