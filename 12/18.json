    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna describes ten more qualities here.\u00a0Alike to friend and foe.\u00a0 Devotees are positively disposed toward all and are not swayed by the sentiments of enmity and friendship.\u00a0 There is a beautiful story about Prahlad regarding this.\u00a0 Once, his son, Virochan, got into an argument with his Guru\u2019s son Sudhanva.\u00a0 Virochan said, \u201cI am superior to you because I am the son of a king.\u201d\u00a0 Sudhanva claimed, \u201cI am superior because I am the son of a \u1e5ai\u1e63hi.\u201d\u00a0 They were both young, and in their impetuousness, they laid bets.\u00a0 Both said, \u201cWhoever is proved superior will live while the other will have to die.\u201d\u00a0 Now, who would be the judge?\u00a0 Sudhanva said to Virochan, \u201cYour father, Prahlad, will be the judge.\u201d\u00a0 Virochan exclaimed, \u201cReally!\u00a0 But then you will complain that he has been partial.\u201d\u00a0 \u201cNo, my father, \u1e5ai\u1e63hi Angira, has said that your father Prahlad is perfectly just, and will never differentiate between friend and foe.\u201dThe two boys went to Prahlad.\u00a0 Virochan asked, \u201cFather, am I superior or Sudhanva?\u201d\u00a0 Prahlad said, \u201cWhy did this question arise?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cFather we have laid bets that whoever is proved superior will remain alive while the other will have to die.\u201d\u00a0 Prahlad smiled and said, \u201cYour friend, Sudhanva, is superior since he is the son of your father\u2019s Guru.\u201d\u00a0 Prahlad ordered his servants, \u201cTake my son to the gallows and hang him.\u201d\u00a0At that moment, Sudhanva intervened.\u00a0 \u201cWait!\u201d he said to Prahlad, \u201cI have a second question.\u00a0 Am I superior or you?\u201d\u00a0 Prahlad replied, \u201cI have been born in a family of demons, while you are the son of a \u1e5ai\u1e63hi, who is also my Guru.\u00a0 Hence, you are superior.\u201d\u00a0 Sudhanva again asked, \u201cIn that case, will you obey my instruction?\u201d\u00a0 \u201cYes, of course,\u201d responded Prahlad.\u00a0 \u201cOk, then leave Virochan,\u201d said Sudhanva.\u00a0 Prahlad instructed his servants, \u201cLeave him,\u201d in the same manner as he had said, \u201cTake him to the gallows.\u201d\u00a0The celestial gods showered flowers into his court, and hailed the quality of justice that Prahlad displayed.\u00a0 This attitude of justice came naturally to Prahlad because by virtue of being a perfect devotee of the Lord he was equal to friend, foe, relative, kith, kin, and outsider.Equipoised in honor and dishonor.\u00a0 Shree Krishna further mentions that the devotees pay no heed to honor and dishonor.\u00a0 This is just like when a person begins engaging in an illicit relationship, he or she is mindful of what others will say, but when the relationship becomes deep, then the person no longer cares about the disrepute it will bring.\u00a0 Similarly, in the heart of the devotee the flame of divine love burns so brightly that worldly honor and dishonor no longer carry any importance.\u00a0\u00a0Alike in cold and heat, joy and sorrow.\u00a0 The devotees are equipoised in favorable and unfavorable circumstances.\u00a0 They know that none of these are permanent.\u00a0 They come and go like the day and the night, and so they do not consider it worth their while to take their thoughts off God and focus on either of them.\u00a0 An incident from the life of Ramakrishna Paramahansa illustrates the nature of saints.\u00a0 He got cancer of the throat in his old age.\u00a0 People asked him to pray to Mother Kali to cure him.\u00a0 He said, \u201cMy mind is absorbed in love for Mother Kali.\u00a0 Why should I take it off from her and apply it to this dirty bodily cancer?\u00a0 Whatever God has willed, let it happen.\u201d\u00a0Free from unfavorable association.\u00a0 Associating with persons or objects is called sa\u1e45g.\u00a0 There are two kinds of sa\u1e45g.\u00a0 Association that takes our mind to the world is kusa\u1e45g (unfavorable association), and that which takes our mind away from the world and toward God is called satsa\u1e45g (favorable association).\u00a0 Since devotees do not relish worldly thoughts, they naturally avoid kusa\u1e45g and engage in satsa\u1e45g.Take praise and reproach alike.\u00a0 For those who are externally motivated, the appreciation and rejection by others is all-important.\u00a0 However, devotees are internally motivated by the principles they value within themselves.\u00a0 Hence, neither commendation nor denunciation by others makes any difference to them.\u00a0Given to silent contemplation.\u00a0 Crows and swans have diametrically opposite choices.\u00a0 While crows are drawn to garbage piles, the majestic swans are attracted by tranquil lakes.\u00a0 Similarly, the minds of worldly people find great relish in conversing about materialistic topics.\u00a0 But the saintly devotees possess pure minds, and thus worldly talks seem as attractive to them as a pile of garbage.\u00a0 This does not mean that they do not converse.\u00a0 Like the swan drawn to the lakes, their minds are drawn toward topics such as the Names, Forms, Pastimes, and Glories of God.Content with whatever comes their way.\u00a0 The needs of the devotees shrink to the bare necessities for maintaining the body.\u00a0 Saint Kabir expresses this in his famous couplet:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 m\u0101lik itan\u0101 d\u012bjiye, j\u0101me ku\u1e6dumba sam\u0101ya\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mai\u1e45 bh\u012b bh\u016bkh\u0101 na rah\u016b\u00f1, s\u0101dhu na bh\u016bkh\u0101 j\u0101ya\u201cO Lord, give me just enough for the bare maintenance of my family\u2019s bodily needs, and for giving alms to the sadhu who comes to my door.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without attachment to the place of residence.\u00a0 No earthly home can be a permanent residence for the soul, for it must necessarily be left behind at the time of death.\u00a0 When the Mogul Emperor, Akbar, built his capital, Fatehpur Sikri, he put the following inscription on the main entrance gate: \u201cThe world is a bridge; cross over it but build no house on it.\u201d\u00a0 In the same vein, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jaga me\u00f1 raho aise govinda radhey, dharma\u015bh\u0101l\u0101 me\u00f1 y\u0101tr\u012b rahe\u00f1 jyo\u00f1 bat\u0101 de(R\u0101dh\u0101 Govind Geet)\u201cLive in this world as a traveler lives in a wayside inn (aware that it is to be vacated the next morning).\u201d\u00a0 Realizing the truth of this statement, devotees look on their home as only a temporary dwelling place.\u00a0\u00a0Intellect is firmly fixed in Me.\u00a0 Devotees have deep conviction in the supremacy of God\u2019s position in creation and in their eternal relationship with Him.\u00a0 They are also firm in their faith that if they surrender to Him lovingly, by God\u2019s grace they will achieve the highest realization.\u00a0 Hence, they neither wander from attraction-to-attraction or from path-to-path.\u00a0 Shree Krishna declares such resolute devotees to be very dear to Him.\u00a0\n",
