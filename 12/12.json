    "commentary": "\nMany people are at the level of mechanical practice.\u00a0 They perform the rituals enjoined by their religious creed, but do not engage their mind in God.\u00a0 When they purchase a new house or a new car, they call the Pundit to perform the p\u016bj\u0101 (worship) ceremony.\u00a0 And while the Pundit performs the p\u016bj\u0101, they sit and talk in the other room or sip a cup of tea.\u00a0 For them, devotion is nothing more than performing the empty ritual.\u00a0 It is often performed by way of ceremonial habits that have been passed on from parents and elders.\u00a0 Performing rituals mechanically is not a bad thing, for after all, something is better than nothing.\u00a0 At least such people are externally engaging in devotion.\u00a0However, Shree Krishna says that higher than mechanical practice is the cultivation of spiritual knowledge.\u00a0 Knowledge bestows the understanding that the goal of life is God-realization and not material progress.\u00a0 One who is versed in knowledge goes beyond the empty rituals and develops the desire to purify the mind.\u00a0 But mere knowledge by itself cannot cleanse the heart.\u00a0 And thus, Shree Krishna says that higher than the cultivation of knowledge is the process of engaging the mind in meditation.\u00a0 By practically controlling the mind through meditation, we begin to develop detachment from worldly pleasures.\u00a0 When the mind develops some measure of the quality of detachment, we can then practice the next step, which is renunciation of the fruits of actions.\u00a0 As explained in the previous verse, this will help remove worldliness from the mind and strengthen the intellect for the subsequent higher stages.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary emphasizes the difference between mechanical practice and true devotion. Many people perform rituals without engaging their mind in God, treating devotion as mere empty ritual. However, Shree Krishna states that true devotion involves cultivating spiritual knowledge and understanding the goal of life as God-realization. Knowledge helps purify the mind, but it alone cannot cleanse the heart. The next step is engaging the mind in meditation to develop detachment from worldly pleasures. Through meditation, the mind gains some measure of detachment, paving the way for renunciation of the fruits of actions. This process removes worldliness from the mind and strengthens the intellect for further spiritual growth."
