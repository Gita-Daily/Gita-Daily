    "commentary": "\nGod can be realized in varying degrees of closeness.\u00a0 Let us understand this through an example.\u00a0 Suppose say you are standing by the railway tracks.\u00a0 A train is coming from the distance, with its headlight shining.\u00a0 It seems to you as if a light is approaching.\u00a0 When the train comes closer, you can see a shimmering form along with the light.\u00a0 Finally, when it comes and stands on the platform in front, you realize, \u201cOh!\u00a0 It\u2019s a train.\u00a0 I can see all these people sitting inside their compartments, and peeping out of their windows.\u201d\u00a0 The same train seemed like a light from far.\u00a0 As it came closer, it appeared to have a shimmering form along with the light.\u00a0 When it drew even nearer, you realized that it was a train.\u00a0 The train was the same, but on being closer to it, your understanding of its different attributes such as shape, color, passengers, compartments, doors, and windows grew.\u00a0Similarly, God is perfect and complete, and is the possessor of unlimited energies.\u00a0 His personality is replete with divine Names, Forms, Pastimes, Virtues, Associates, and Abodes.\u00a0 However, He is realized in varying levels of closeness, as the Brahman (formless all-pervading manifestation of God), the Param\u0101tm\u0101 (the Supreme Soul seated in the heart of all living beings, distinct from the individual soul), and Bhagav\u0101n (the personal manifestation of God that descends upon the earth).\u00a0 The Bhagavatam states:vadanti tat tattva vidastattva\u1e41 yaj-j\u00f1\u0101namadvayambrahmeti param\u0101tmeti bhagav\u0101n iti \u015bhabdyate\u00a0\u00a0 (1.2.11)\u201cThe knowers of the Truth have stated that there is only one Supreme Entity that manifests in three ways in the world\u2014Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\u00a0 They are not three different Gods; rather, They are three manifestations of the one Almighty God.\u00a0 However, Their qualities are different.\u00a0 This is just as water, steam, and ice are all made from the same substance\u2014H2O molecules\u2014but their physical qualities are different.\u00a0 If a thirsty person asks for water, and we give ice, it will not quench the thirst.\u00a0 Ice and water are both the same substance but their physical properties are different.\u00a0 Similarly, Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n are manifestations of the one Supreme Lord but Their qualities are different.\u00a0\u00a0Brahman is the all-pervading form of God, which is everywhere.\u00a0 The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:eko deva\u1e25 sarvabh\u016bte\u1e63hu g\u016b\u1e0dha\u1e25sarvavy\u0101p\u012b sarvabh\u016bt\u0101ntar\u0101tm\u0101...(6.11)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThere is only one Supreme Entity.\u00a0 He is seated in everything and everyone.\u201d\u00a0 This all-pervading aspect of the Lord is called Brahman.\u00a0 It is full of eternality, knowledge, and bliss.\u00a0 However in this aspect, God does not manifest His infinite qualities, enchanting personal beauty, and sweet Pastimes.\u00a0 He is like a divine light that is nirgu\u1e47a (without qualities), nirviv\u015be\u1e63h (without attributes), nir\u0101k\u0101r (without form).\u00a0Those who follow the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog worship this aspect of God.\u00a0 This is a distant realization of God as a formless light, just as the train from far appeared like light.Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the aspect of God that is seated in everyone\u2019s hearts.\u00a0 In verse 18.61, Shree Krishna states: \u201cThe Supreme Lord dwells in the hearts of all living beings, O Arjun. According to their karmas, He directs the wanderings of the souls, who are seated on a machine made of material energy.\u201d\u00a0 Residing within, God notes all our thoughts and actions, keeps an account of them, and gives the results at the appropriate time.\u00a0 We may forget what we have done, but God does not.\u00a0 He remembers our every thought, word, and deed, since we were born.\u00a0 And not only in this life!\u00a0 In endless lifetimes, wherever we went, God went along with us.\u00a0 He is such a friend who never leaves us for even a moment.\u00a0 This aspect of God dwelling within is the Param\u0101tm\u0101.\u00a0The path of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, as revealed by Patanjali in the Yog Dar\u015bhan, strives to realize God seated inside, and leads to the Param\u0101tm\u0101 realization of God.\u00a0 Just as the train, which appeared as light from far, was seen as a shimmering form when it came closer, similarly, the realization of the Supreme Entity as Param\u0101tm\u0101 is a closer realization than Brahman.\u00a0Bhagav\u0101n is the aspect of God that manifests with a personal form.\u00a0 The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47am enam avehi tvam \u0101tm\u0101nam akhil\u0101tman\u0101mjagad-dhit\u0101ya so \u2019pyatra deh\u012bv\u0101bh\u0101ti m\u0101yay\u0101\u00a0\u00a0 (10.14.55)\u201cThe Supreme Lord Who is the Soul of all souls, has descended upon the earth in His personal form, as Shree Krishna, for the welfare of the world.\u201d\u00a0 In this Bhagav\u0101n aspect, God manifests all the sweetness of His Names, Forms, Qualities, Abodes, Pastimes, and Associates.\u00a0 These attributes exist in Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 as well, but they remain latent, just as fire is latent in a match-stick, and only manifests when it is struck against the igniting strip of the matchbox.\u00a0 Similarly, as Bhagav\u0101n, all the powers and aspects of God\u2019s personality, which are latent in the other forms, get revealed.The path of bhakti, or devotion, leads to the realization of the Supreme Entity in His Bhagav\u0101n aspect.\u00a0 This is the closest realization of God, just as the details of a train become visible when it comes and stops in front of the observer.\u00a0 Hence, in verse 18.55, Shree Krishna states:\u00a0\u201cOnly by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna answers Arjun\u2019s question by clarifying that He considers the devotee of His personal form to be the highest yogi.\u00a0\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains the varying degrees of realization of God using the analogy of a train approaching. Just as a train appears as a distant light and gradually reveals its form and details as it comes closer, God can be realized in different ways. The three manifestations of God are Brahman (formless all-pervading), Param\u0101tm\u0101 (seated in the hearts of all beings), and Bhagav\u0101n (personal manifestation on Earth). While they are not different Gods, their qualities differ. The path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog realizes the formless Brahman, a distant realization. The path of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog leads to the Param\u0101tm\u0101, a closer realization. The path of bhakti leads to the realization of God as Bhagav\u0101n, the closest realization where all aspects of God's personality are revealed. Shree Krishna emphasizes that loving devotion to Him leads to the highest realization of God.",
