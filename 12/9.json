    "newest_commentary": "The commentary explains that fixing the mind on Shree Krishna is the goal of spiritual practice, but it takes time to achieve perfection. For those unable to do so, Shree Krishna advises remembering Him with devotion. This is known as abhy\u0101sa yog, or union with God through repeated practice. The devotee must bring the wandering mind back to God by remembering His various aspects. Renowned spiritual teacher Shree Kripaluji Maharaj also emphasizes the importance of continuous practice in his instructions. He advises removing the mind from worldly distractions and constantly fixing it on God."
