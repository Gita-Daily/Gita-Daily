    "commentary": "\nHaving explained that worship of the personal form is better, Shree Krishna now begins to explain how to worship Him.\u00a0 He asks Arjun to do two things\u2014fix the mind on God and also surrender the intellect to Him.\u00a0 The function of the mind is to create desires, attractions, and aversions.\u00a0 The function of the intellect is to think, analyze, and discriminate.The importance of the mind has been repeatedly stated in the Vedic scriptures:\u00a0cheta\u1e25 khalvasya bandh\u0101ya muktaye ch\u0101tmano matamgu\u1e47e\u1e63hu sakta\u1e41 bandh\u0101ya rata\u1e41 v\u0101 pu\u1e41si muktaye(Bhagavatam 3.25.15)\u201cCaptivity in Maya and liberation from it is determined by the mind.\u00a0 If it is attached to the world, one is in bondage, and if the mind is detached from the world, one gets liberated.\u201d\u00a0mana eva manu\u1e63hy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 k\u0101ra\u1e47a\u1e41 bandha mok\u1e63hayo\u1e25\u00a0 \u00a0(Pa\u00f1chada\u015bh\u012b)\u201cBondage and liberation are decided by the state of the mind.\u201d\u00a0 Mere physical devotion is not sufficient; we must absorb the mind in thinking of God.\u00a0 The reason is that without the engagement of the mind, mere sensory activity is of no value.\u00a0 For example, we hear a sermon with our ears, but if the mind wanders off, we will not know what was said.\u00a0 The words will fall on the ears but they will not register.\u00a0 This shows that without engaging the mind the work of the senses does not count.\u00a0 On the other hand, the mind is such an instrument that in it all the senses reside in the subtle form.\u00a0 Thus, even without the actual sensory activity the mind experiences the perceptions of sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound.\u00a0 For example, at night when we sleep our senses are inactive.\u00a0 Yet while dreaming, our mind experiences the objects of all the senses.\u00a0 This proves that the mind has the capacity to experience all perceptions even without the gross senses.\u00a0 Therefore, while noting our karmas, God gives importance to the mental works and not the physical works of the senses.\u00a0Even beyond the mind is the intellect.\u00a0 We can only fix the mind upon God when we surrender our intellect to Him.\u00a0 In material pursuits as well, when we face situations beyond the capability of our intellect, we take guidance from a person with superior intellect.\u00a0 For example, we visit a doctor when we are sick.\u00a0 We have no knowledge of medical science ourselves, and so we follow the advice of a qualified medical doctor.\u00a0 The doctor checks our symptoms, looks at our medical reports, makes a diagnosis, and then prescribes the medicines.\u00a0 We surrender our intellect and take the medicines according to the doctor\u2019s prescription.\u00a0 Similarly, if we are involved in a legal case, we take the help of a lawyer.\u00a0 The lawyer instructs us how to handle the interrogation by the opposing lawyer.\u00a0 Having no knowledge of law ourselves, we surrender our intellect and simply do as the lawyer says.\u00a0In the same way, at present our intellect is subject to many defects.\u00a0 Akrur, who went to get Shree Krishna from Vrindavan to Mathura,\u00a0described these imperfections of the intellect in the Bhagavatam (10.40.25):\u00a0 anity\u0101n\u0101tma du\u1e25khe\u1e63hu viparyaya matirhyaham\u00a0 Akrur said: \u201cOur intellect is strapped with wrong knowledge.\u00a0 Though we are eternal souls, we think of ourselves to be the perishable body.\u00a0 Although all the objects of the world are perishable, we think they will always remain with us, and hence, we busily accumulate them day and night.\u00a0 And though the pursuit of sensual pleasures only results in misery in the long run, we still chase them in the hope that we will find happiness.\u201d\u00a0 The above three defects of the intellect are called viparyaya, or reversals of knowledge under material illusion.\u00a0 The gravity of our problem is further aggravated because our intellect is habituated to this kind of defective thinking from innumerable previous lifetimes.\u00a0 If we run our lives in accordance with the directions of our intellect, we will definitely not make much progress on the divine path.\u00a0 Thus, if we wish to achieve spiritual success by attaching the mind to God, we must surrender our intellect to Him and follow His directions.\u00a0 Surrendering the intellect means to think in accordance with the knowledge received from God via the medium of the scriptures and the bonafide Guru.\u00a0 The characteristics of a surrendered intellect are described in verse 18.62.\u00a0\n",

He advises Arjun to focus his mind on God and surrender his intellect to Him. The mind creates desires and the intellect thinks and discriminates. Without engaging the mind, sensory activities hold no value. The mind holds all the senses in a subtle form and can experience perceptions even without sensory input. God gives importance to mental works over physical works of the senses. Surrendering the intellect allows us to fix the mind on God. Akrur describes the imperfections of the intellect, such as wrong knowledge and attachment to perishable things. Our intellect is conditioned by defective thinking from previous lifetimes. To progress on the spiritual path, we must surrender our intellect and follow God's directions by aligning our thinking with scripture and the guidance of a genuine Guru.",
