    "commentary": "\nThe mind is pleasure seeking by nature and, being a product of the material energy, is spontaneously inclined to material pleasures.\u00a0 If we follow the inclinations of our mind, we become degraded into deeper and deeper material consciousness.\u00a0 The way to prevent this downslide is to keep the mind in check with the help of the intellect.\u00a0 For this, the intellect needs to be empowered with true knowledge.Those, who learn to see God as the Supreme Soul present in all beings, begin to live by this knowledge.\u00a0 They no longer seek personal gain and enjoyment in their relationships with others.\u00a0 They neither get attached to others for the good done by them, nor hate them for any harm caused by them.\u00a0 Rather, seeing everyone as a part of God, they maintain a healthy attitude of respect and service toward others.\u00a0 They naturally refrain from mistreating, cheating, or insulting others, when they perceive in them the presence of God.\u00a0 Also, the humanly created distinctions of nationality, creed, caste, sex, status, and color, all become irrelevant.\u00a0 Thus, they elevate their mind by seeing God in all living beings, and finally reach the supreme goal.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "The commentary explains that the mind is naturally drawn towards material pleasures, which degrades consciousness. To prevent this, one needs to empower the intellect with true knowledge. By recognizing God as the Supreme Soul in all beings, individuals live by this knowledge and overcome personal desires. They treat others with respect and service, realizing the presence of God within them. Human-made distinctions like nationality, creed, caste, sex, status, and color become insignificant as they see God in everyone. This mindset uplifts the mind and leads to the attainment of the ultimate goal."
