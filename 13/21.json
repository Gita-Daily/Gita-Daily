    "new_commentary": "The material energy, under the guidance of Brahma, creates various elements and life forms in the universe. According to the Vedas, there are 8.4 million species in the material world, all of which are manifestations of the material energy. Material nature is responsible for the cause and effect in the world. The soul attains a particular body based on its past actions and identifies itself with the body, mind, and intellect. It seeks pleasure through the senses, and when the senses come in contact with their objects, the mind experiences pleasure. The soul perceives these sensations of pleasure and pain through the senses, mind, and intellect, similar to a dream state. Just as a dream brings temporary suffering until one wakes up, the soul experiences pleasure and pain in this illusory identification with the body. Therefore, the soul is responsible for both experiences based on its past and present actions.",
