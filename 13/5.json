    "commentary": "\nKnowledge is appealing to the intellect when it is expressed with precision and clarity, and is substantiated with sound logic.\u00a0 Further, for it to be accepted as infallible, it must be confirmed on the basis of infallible authority.\u00a0 The reference for validating spiritual knowledge is the Vedas.\u00a0Vedas:\u00a0 These are not just the name of some books; they are the eternal knowledge of God.\u00a0 Whenever God creates the world, He manifests the Vedas for the benefit of the souls.\u00a0 The B\u1e5bihad\u0101ra\u1e47yak Upani\u1e63had (4.5.11) states:\u00a0 ni\u1e25\u015bhvasitamasya ved\u0101\u1e25 \u00a0\u201cThe Vedas manifested from the breath of God.\u201d\u00a0 They were first revealed in the heart of the first-born Brahma.\u00a0 From there, they came down through the oral tradition, and hence, another name for them is \u015ahruti, or \u201cknowledge received through the ear.\u201d\u00a0 At the beginning of the age of Kali, Ved Vyas, who was himself a descension of God, put down the Vedas in the form of a book, and divided the one body of knowledge into four portions\u2014\u1e5aig Veda, Yajur Veda, S\u0101ma Veda, and Atharva Veda.\u00a0 Hence, he got the name Ved Vy\u0101s, or \u201cone who divided the Vedas.\u201d\u00a0 The distinction must be borne in mind that Ved Vyas is never referred to as the composer of the Vedas but merely the one who divided them.\u00a0 Hence, the Vedas are also called apauru\u1e63heya, which means \u201cnot created by any person.\u201d\u00a0 They are respected as the infallible authority for spiritual knowledge.\u00a0bh\u016bta\u1e41 bhavya\u1e41 bhavi\u1e63hya\u1e41 cha sarva\u1e41 ved\u0101t prasidhyati\u00a0 (Manu Sm\u1e5biti 12.97)\u201cAny spiritual principle must be validated on the authority of the Vedas.\u201d\u00a0 To elaborate this knowledge of the Vedas, many sages wrote texts and these traditionally became included in the gamut of the Vedic scriptures because they conform to the authority of the Vedas.\u00a0 Some of the important Vedic scriptures are listed below.Itih\u0101s:\u00a0 These are historical texts, and are two in number, the Ramayan and the Mahabharat.\u00a0 They describe the history related to two important descensions of God.\u00a0 The Ramayan was written by Sage Valmiki, and describes the Leelas, or divine Pastimes, of Lord Ram.\u00a0 Amazingly, it was written by Valmiki before Shree Ram actually displayed His Leelas.\u00a0 The great poet Sage was empowered with divine vision, by which he could see the Pastimes Lord Ram would enact on descending in the world.\u00a0 He thus put them down in 24,000 most beautifully composed Sanskrit verses of the Ramayan.\u00a0 These verses also contain lessons on ideal behavior in various social roles, such as son, brother, wife, king, and married couples.\u00a0 The Ramayan has also been written in many regional languages of India, thereby increasing its popularity amongst the people.\u00a0 The most famous amongst these is the Hindi Ramayan, Ramcharit Manas, written by a great devotee of Lord Ram, Saint Tulsidas.The Mahabharat was written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 It contains 100,000 verses and is considered the longest poem in the world.\u00a0 The divine Leelas of Lord Krishna are the central theme of the Mahabharat.\u00a0 It is full of wisdom and guidance related to duties in all stages of human life, and devotion to God.\u00a0 The Bhagavad Gita is a portion of the Mahabharat.\u00a0 It is the most popular Hindu scripture, since it contains the essence of spiritual knowledge, so beautifully described by Lord Krishna Himself.\u00a0 It has been translated in many different languages of the world.\u00a0 Innumerable commentaries have been written on the Bhagavad Gita.Puranas:\u00a0 There are eighteen Puranas, written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 Together, they contain 400,000 verses.\u00a0 These describe the divine Pastimes of the various forms of God and His devotees.\u00a0 The Puranas are also full of philosophic knowledge.\u00a0 They discuss the creation of the universe, its annihilation and recreation, the history of humankind, the genealogy of the celestial gods and the holy sages.\u00a0 The most important amongst them is the Bh\u0101gavat Pur\u0101\u1e47, or the Shreemad Bhagavatam.\u00a0 It was the last scripture written by Sage Ved Vyas.\u00a0 In it, he mentions that in this scripture, he is going to reveal the highest dharma of pure selfless love for God.\u00a0 Philosophically, the Shreemad Bhagavatam begins where the Bhagavad Gita ends.\u1e62ha\u1e0d-dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 These come next in importance amongst the Vedic scriptures.\u00a0 Six sages wrote six scriptures highlighting particular aspects of Hindu philosophy.\u00a0 These became known as the \u1e62ha\u1e0d-dar\u015bhan, or six philosophic works.\u00a0 They are:1. M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi (Sage) Jaimini, it describes ritualistic duties and ceremonies.2. Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Ved Vyas, it discusses the nature of the Absolute Truth.3. Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Gautam, it develops a system of logic for understanding life and the Absolute Truth.4. Vai\u015bhe\u1e63hik Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Kanad, it analyses cosmology and creation from the perspective of its various elements.5. Yog Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Pata\u00f1jali, it describes an eightfold path to union with God, beginning with physical postures.6. S\u0101nkhya Dar\u015bhan:\u00a0 Written by Maharishi Kapil, it describes the evolution of the Universe from prak\u1e5biti, the primordial form of the material energy.Apart from these mentioned above, there are hundreds of other scriptures in the Hindu tradition.\u00a0 It would be impossible to describe them all here.\u00a0 Let it suffice to say that the Vedic scriptures are a vast treasure house of divine knowledge revealed by God and the saints for the eternal welfare of all humankind.\u00a0Amongst these scriptural texts, the Brahma S\u016btra (Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan) is considered as the last word on the topic of the distinction between the soul, the material body, and God.\u00a0 Hence, Shree Krishna particularly mentions it in the above verse.\u00a0 \u201cVed\u201d refers to the Vedas, and \u201cant\u201d means \u201cthe conclusion.\u201d\u00a0 Consequently, \u201cVed\u0101nt\u201d means \u201cthe conclusion of Vedic knowledge.\u201d\u00a0 Although, the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan was written by Sage Ved Vyas, many great scholars accepted it as the reference authority for philosophical dissertation and wrote commentaries on it to establish their unique philosophic viewpoint regarding the soul and God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shankaracharya\u2019s commentary on the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan is called \u015ah\u0101r\u012brak Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, which lays the foundation for the advait-v\u0101d tradition of philosophy.\u00a0 Many of his followers, such as Vachaspati and Padmapada have elaborated upon his commentary.\u00a0 Jagadguru Nimbarkarcharya wrote the Ved\u0101nt P\u0101rij\u0101ta Saurabh, which explains the dwait-advait-v\u0101d school of thought.\u00a0 Jagadguru Ramanujacharya\u2019s commentary is called \u015ahr\u012b Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, which lays the basis for the vi\u015bhi\u1e63h\u1e6d-advait-v\u0101d system of philosophy.\u00a0 Jagadguru Madhvacharya\u2019s commentary is called Brahma S\u016btra Bh\u0101\u1e63hyam, which is the foundation for the dwait-v\u0101d school of thought.\u00a0 Mahaprabhu Vallabhacharya wrote A\u1e47u Bh\u0101\u1e63hya, in which he established the \u015bhuddhadvait-v\u0101d system of philosophy.\u00a0 Apart from these, some of the other well-known commentators have been Bhat Bhaskar, Yadav Prakash, Keshav, Nilakanth, Vijnanabhikshu, and Baladev Vidyabhushan.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, himself a Vedic scholar par excellence, did not write any commentary on the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan.\u00a0 He took the view that the writer of the Ved\u0101nt, Sage Ved Vyas himself, declared that his final scripture the Shreemad Bhagavatam is its perfect commentary:arthoya\u1e41 brahmas\u016btr\u0101\u1e47a\u1e41 sarvopani\u1e63had\u0101mapi\u201cThe Shreemad Bhagavatam reveals the meaning and the essence of the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan and all the Upanishads.\u201d\u00a0 Hence, out of respect for Ved Vyas, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu did not deem it fit to write another commentary on the scripture.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary discusses the importance of knowledge that is precise, logical, and supported by authoritative sources. The Vedas, revealed to Brahma and transmitted orally, are considered eternal knowledge. Ved Vyas divided them into four parts and recorded them. The Vedas are respected as an infallible authority on spirituality. Other Vedic scriptures like the Ramayan and Mahabharat contain divine pastimes and lessons on ideal behavior. The Puranas describe God's activities, human history, and creation. The \u1e62ha\u1e0d-dar\u015bhan are philosophical works by different sages. The Brahma S\u016btra, mentioned by Krishna, delves into the soul, body, and God. Commentaries on Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan were written by scholars like Shankaracharya, Nimbarkarcharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, and Vallabhacharya. Chaitanya Mahaprabhu considered the Shreemad Bhagavatam as the perfect commentary on the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan.",
