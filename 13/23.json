    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains the position of the Param\u0101tm\u0101 (Supreme Soul) who resides within the body. He is the knower of all infinite bodies and manifests as Lord Vishnu, responsible for maintaining creation and residing in the K\u1e63h\u012br S\u0101gar. The Param\u0101tm\u0101 also resides in the hearts of all beings, noting their actions, keeping track of their karmas, and bestowing results accordingly. He accompanies the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 to each new body in every lifetime, even residing in the bodies of snakes, pigs, or insects. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had illustrates the relationship between the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 and Param\u0101tm\u0101, where the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 enjoys the fruits of its karmas while the Param\u0101tm\u0101 silently observes. Turning towards the Param\u0101tm\u0101 can end the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101's miseries. The j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 possesses free will, which, when used improperly, leads to bondage. However, by utilizing it properly, the j\u012bv\u0101tm\u0101 can attain eternal service to God and experience infinite bliss."
