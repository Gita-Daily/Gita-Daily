    "new_commentary": "The commentary states that God's personality encompasses His various energies, and all existing objects are expansions of His energy. Shreemad Bhagavatam affirms that everything in creation, including time, karma, individual natures, and material ingredients, is the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna Himself. Despite appearing divided amongst His creation, God remains undivided as He is all that exists. The analogy of space containing objects illustrates this concept. Just as the ocean creates and absorbs waves, God creates, maintains, and absorbs the world back into Himself. Therefore, He can be seen as the Creator, Maintainer, and Destroyer of everything.",
