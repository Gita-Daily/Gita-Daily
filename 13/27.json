    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna uses the words y\u0101vat ki\u00f1chit, meaning \u201cwhatsoever form of life that exists,\u201d regardless of how enormous or infinitesimal it may be, is all born of the union of the k\u1e63hetraj\u00f1a (knower of the field) and the k\u1e63hetra (field of activities).\u00a0 The Abrahamic traditions accept the existence of the soul in humans, but do not accept that other forms of life also have souls.\u00a0 This concept condones violence toward the other life forms.\u00a0 However, the Vedic philosophy stresses that wherever consciousness exists, there must be the presence of the soul.\u00a0 Without it, there can be no consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0In the early twentieth century, Sir J.C. Bose established through experiments that even plants, which are non-moving life forms, can feel and respond to emotions.\u00a0 His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.\u00a0 When a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird.\u00a0 And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.\u00a0 The changes in the vibrations of the tree reveal that it also possesses consciousness and can experience semblances of emotions.\u00a0 These observations corroborate Shree Krishna\u2019s statement here that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy.\n",

    "new_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that all forms of life, regardless of their size, are born from the union of the knower of the field and the field of activities. Unlike the Abrahamic traditions, Vedic philosophy recognizes that all life forms have souls and consciousness. Sir J.C. Bose's experiments in the early 20th century demonstrated that even plants can feel emotions and respond to stimuli. The vibrations of a tree when a bird is shot or when a loving gardener enters the garden suggest that trees also possess consciousness and can experience emotions. This aligns with Shree Krishna's statement that all life forms possess consciousness, as they are a combination of the eternal soul and the insentient material body.",

Vedic philosophy recognizes that all life forms have souls and consciousness, supported by Sir J.C. Bose's experiments showing plants can feel emotions. Even trees exhibit consciousness and emotional responses, as demonstrated by their vibrations when a bird is shot or when a gardener approaches.
