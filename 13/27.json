Bose established through experiments that even plants, which are non-moving life forms, can feel and respond to emotions.\u00a0 His experiments proved that soothing music can enhance the growth of plants.\u00a0 When a hunter shoots a bird sitting on a tree, the vibrations of the tree seem to indicate that it weeps for the bird.\u00a0 And when a loving gardener enters the garden, the trees feel joyous.\u00a0 The changes in the vibrations of the tree reveal that it also possesses consciousness and can experience semblances of emotions.\u00a0 These observations corroborate Shree Krishna\u2019s statement here that all life forms possess consciousness; they are the combination of the eternal soul, which is the source of consciousness, and the body, which is made of the insentient material energy.\n", "next shlok": 28}
