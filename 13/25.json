    "commentary": "\nVariety is the universal characteristic of God\u2019s creation.\u00a0 No two leaves of a tree are alike; no two human beings have exactly the same fingerprints; no two human societies have the same features.\u00a0 Similarly, all souls are unique, and they have their distinctive traits that have been acquired in their unique journey through the cycle of life and death.\u00a0 So in the realm of spiritual practice as well, not all are attracted to the same kind of practice.\u00a0 The beauty of the Bhagavad Gita and the Vedic scriptures is that they realize this inherent variety amongst human beings and accommodate it in their instructions.Here, Shree Krishna explains that some s\u0101dhaks (aspirants) find great joy in grappling with their mind and bringing it under control.\u00a0 They are attracted to meditating upon God seated within their hearts.\u00a0 They relish the spiritual bliss that they experience when their mind comes to rest upon the Lord within them.\u00a0Others find satisfaction in exercising their intellect.\u00a0 The idea of the distinction of the soul and the body, mind, intellect, and ego excites them greatly.\u00a0 They relish cultivating knowledge about the three entities\u2014soul, God, and Maya\u2014through the processes of \u015bhrava\u1e47a, manan, nididhy\u0101san (hearing, contemplating, and internalizing with firm faith).\u00a0Yet others find their spirits soaring when they can engage in meaningful action.\u00a0 They strive to engage their God-given abilities in working for Him.\u00a0 Nothing satisfies them more than using the last drop of their energy in service of God.\u00a0 In this way, all kinds of s\u0101dhaks utilize their individual propensities for realizing the Supreme.\u00a0 The fulfillment of any endeavor involving knowledge, action, love, etc. is when it is combined with devotion for the pleasure of God.\u00a0 The Shreemad Bhagavatam states:s\u0101 vidy\u0101 tanmatir yay\u0101\u00a0 \u00a0(4.29.49)\u201cTrue knowledge is that which helps us develop love for God.\u00a0 The fulfillment of karma occurs when it is done for the pleasure of the Lord.\u201d\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, it is acknowledged that all souls are unique and have their own distinct traits acquired through their journey of life and death. Just as there is variety in the creation of God, there is also diversity in spiritual practices. Some find joy in controlling their minds and meditating on God within. Others are fascinated by the distinction between the soul, body, mind, intellect, and ego, and seek knowledge through listening, contemplation, and internalization. There are also those who find fulfillment in engaging in meaningful actions for God. The key is to utilize individual tendencies to realize the Supreme, combining knowledge, action, and love with devotion for God. The Shreemad Bhagavatam teaches that true knowledge helps develop love for God, and karma is fulfilled when done for the Lord's pleasure.",
