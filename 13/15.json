    "commentary": "\nHaving stated that God\u2019s senses are everywhere, Shree Krishna now states the exact opposite, that He does not possess any senses.\u00a0 If we try to understand this through mundane logic, we will find this contradictory.\u00a0 We will inquire, \u201cHow can God have both infinite senses and also be without senses?\u201d\u00a0 However, mundane logic does not apply to Him who is beyond the reach of the intellect.\u00a0 God possesses infinite contradictory attributes at the same time.\u00a0 The Brahma Vaivarta Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:viruddha dharmo r\u016bpos\u0101 vai\u015bhvary\u0101t puru\u1e63hottam\u0101h\u201cThe Supreme Lord is the reservoir of innumerable contradictory attributes.\u201d\u00a0 In this verse, Shree Krishna mentions a few of the infinite contradictory attributes that exist in the personality of God.He is devoid of mundane senses like ours, and hence it is correct to say that He does not have senses.\u00a0 Sarvendriya vivarjitam means \u201cHe is without material senses.\u201d\u00a0 However, He possesses divine senses that are everywhere, consequently, it is also correct to say that the senses of God are in all places.\u00a0 Sarvendriya gu\u1e47\u0101bh\u0101sa\u1e41 means \u201cHe manifests the functions of the senses and grasps the sense objects.\u201d\u00a0 Including both these attributes, the \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had \u00a0states:ap\u0101\u1e47ip\u0101do javano grah\u012bt\u0101, pa\u015bhyatyachak\u1e63hu\u1e25 sa \u015bh\u1e5bi\u1e47otyakar\u1e47a\u1e25\u00a0(3.19)\u00a0\u201cGod does not possess material hands, feet, eyes, and ears.\u00a0 Yet He grasps, walks, sees, and hears.\u201dFurther, Shree Krishna states that He is the sustainer of creation, and yet detached from it.\u00a0 In His form as Lord Vishnu, God maintains the entire creation.\u00a0 He sits in the hearts of all living beings, notes their karmas, and gives the results.\u00a0 Under Lord Vishnu\u2019s dominion, Brahma manipulates the laws of material science to ensure that the universe functions stably.\u00a0 Also, under Lord Vishnu\u2019s dominion, the celestial gods arrange to provide the air, earth, water, rain, etc. that are necessary for our survival.\u00a0 Hence, God is the Sustainer of all.\u00a0 Yet, He is complete in Himself and is, thus, detached from everyone.\u00a0 The Vedas mention Him as \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m, meaning \u201cone who rejoices in the self and has no need of anything external.\u201dThe material energy is subservient to God, and it works for His pleasure by serving Him.\u00a0 He is thus the enjoyer of the three gu\u1e47as (modes of material nature).\u00a0 At the same time, He is also nirgu\u1e47a (beyond the three gu\u1e47as), because these gu\u1e47as are material, while God is divine.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna explains his contradictory attributes. Despite being beyond logic, God possesses infinite senses yet is without material senses. He manifests the functions of senses and grasps sense objects through his divine senses. As the sustainer of creation, he remains detached from it. Lord Vishnu, in his form, maintains the universe and oversees the actions and results of all beings. The celestial gods provide the necessary elements for survival under Lord Vishnu's dominion. God, known as \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m, rejoices in the self and requires nothing external. He enjoys the three gu\u1e47as, or material modes, while being beyond them as nirgu\u1e47a. The material energy serves God's pleasure. This commentary highlights the divine nature of God and his ability to encompass contradictory attributes.",
