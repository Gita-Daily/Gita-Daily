"commentary": "\nTo gain knowledge of the k\u1e63hetra and k\u1e63hetraj\u00f1a is not merely an intellectual exercise.\u00a0 Unlike bookish knowledge that can be cultivated without a change in one\u2019s character, the spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about requires purification of the heart.\u00a0 (Here, heart does not refer to the physical organ.\u00a0 The inner apparatus of mind and intellect is also sometimes referred to as the heart.)\u00a0 These five verses describe the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes that purify one\u2019s life and illuminate it with the light of knowledge.Humbleness.\u00a0 When we become proud of the attributes of our individual field, such as beauty, intellect, talent, strength, etc. we forget that God has given all these attributes to us.\u00a0 Pride thus results in distancing our consciousness from God.\u00a0 It is a big obstacle on the path of self-realization since it contaminates the entire field by affecting the qualities of the mind and intellect.Freedom from hypocrisy.\u00a0 The hypocrite develops an artificial external personality.\u00a0 A person is defective from inside, but creates a facade of virtuosity on the outside.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the external display of virtues is skin-deep and hollow.\u00a0Non-violence.\u00a0 The cultivation of knowledge requires respect for all living beings.\u00a0 This requires the practice of non-violence. \u00a0Hence the scriptures state: \u0101tmana\u1e25 pratik\u016bl\u0101ni pare\u015bh\u0101\u1e41 na sam\u0101charet\u00a0 \u201cIf you dislike a certain behavior from others, do not behave with them in that manner yourself.\u201d\u00a0Forgiveness.\u00a0 It is freedom from ill will even toward those who have harmed one.\u00a0 Actually, harboring ill will harms oneself more than the other.\u00a0 By practicing forgiveness, a person of discrimination releases the negativities in the mind and purifies it.Simplicity.\u00a0 It is straightforwardness in thought, speech, and action.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in thought includes absence of deceit, envy, crookedness, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in speech includes absence of taunt, censure, gossip, ornamentation, etc.\u00a0 Straightforwardness in action includes plainness in living, forthrightness in behavior, etc.Service of the Guru.\u00a0 Spiritual knowledge is received from the Guru.\u00a0 This imparting of divine knowledge requires the disciple to have an attitude of dedication and devotion toward the Guru.\u00a0 By serving the Guru, the disciple develops humbleness and commitment that enables the Guru to impart knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna explained to Arjun in verse 4.34:\u00a0 \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master.\u00a0 Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him.\u00a0 Such an enlightened saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dCleanliness of body and mind.\u00a0 Purity should be both internal and external.\u00a0 The \u015ah\u0101\u1e47dilya Upani\u1e63had states:\u00a0 \u015bhaucha\u1e41 n\u0101ma dwividha\u1e41-b\u0101hyam\u0101ntara\u1e41 cheti (1.1)\u00a0 \u201cThere are two types of cleanliness\u2014internal and external.\u201d\u00a0 External cleanliness is helpful in maintaining good health, developing discipline, and uncluttering the mind.\u00a0 But mental cleanliness is even more important, and it is achieved by focusing the mind on the all-pure God.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:m\u0101y\u0101dh\u012bn mal\u012bn mana, hai an\u0101di k\u0101l\u012bn,hari virah\u0101nala dhoya jala, karu nirmala bani d\u012bn.\u00a0\u00a0 (Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 79)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cThe material mind is dirty since endless lifetimes.\u00a0 Purify it in the fire of longing for God, while practicing utmost humility.\u201d\u00a0Steadfastness.\u00a0 Self-knowledge and God-realization are not goals that are attainable in a day.\u00a0 Steadfastness is the persistence to remain on the path until the goal is reached.\u00a0 The scriptures state:\u00a0 charaivaite charaivate, charan vai madhu vindati\u00a0 \u201cKeep moving forward.\u00a0 Keep moving forward.\u00a0 Those who do not give up will get the honey at the end.\u201d\u00a0Self-control.\u00a0 It is the restraint of the mind and the senses from running after mundane pleasures that dirty the mind and intellect.\u00a0 Self-control prevents the dissipation of the personality through indulgence.Dispassion toward the objects of the senses.\u00a0 It is a stage higher than the self-control mentioned above, in which we restrain ourselves by force.\u00a0 Dispassion means a lack of taste for sense pleasures that are obstacles on the path of God-realization.Absence of egotism.\u00a0 Egotism is the conscious awareness of \u201cI,\u201d \u201cme,\u201d and \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 This is classified as nescience because it is at the bodily level, arising out of the identification of the self with the body.\u00a0 It is also called the aham chetan\u0101 (pride arising out of the sense of self).\u00a0 All mystics emphatically declare that to invite God into our hearts, we must get rid of the pride of the self.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jaba mai\u1e45 th\u0101 taba hari nath\u012b\u1e45, ab hari hai, mai\u1e45 n\u0101h\u012b\u1e45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 prem gal\u012b ati sankar\u012b, y\u0101 me\u1e45 dwe na sam\u0101h\u012b\u1e45\u00a0\u00a0 (Saint Kabir)\u201cWhen \u2018I\u2019 existed, God was not there; now God exists and \u2018I\u2019 do not.\u00a0 The path of divine love is very narrow; it cannot accommodate both \u2018I\u2019 and God.\u201d\u00a0In the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog and a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, there are elaborate s\u0101dhan\u0101s for getting rid of the aham chetan\u0101.\u00a0 But in the path of bhakti-yog, it gets eliminated very simply.\u00a0 We add d\u0101s (servant) in front of aham (the sense of self), making it d\u0101soham (I am the servant of God).\u00a0 Now the \u201cI\u201d no longer remains harmful and self-consciousness is replaced by God-consciousness.\u00a0Keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old-age and death.\u00a0 If the intellect is undecided about what is more important\u2014material enhancement or spiritual wealth\u2014then it becomes difficult to develop the strong will required for acquiring knowledge of the self.\u00a0 But when the intellect is convinced about the unattractiveness of the world, it becomes firm in its resolve.\u00a0 To get this firmness, we should constantly contemplate about the miseries that are an inseparable part of life in the material world.\u00a0 This is what set the Buddha on the spiritual path.\u00a0 He saw a sick person, and thought, \u201cO there is sickness in the world.\u00a0 I will also have to fall sick one day.\u201d\u00a0 Then He saw an old person, and thought, \u201cThere is also old age.\u00a0 This means that I will also become old one day.\u201d\u00a0 After that, He saw a dead person, and realized, \u201cThis is also a part of existence.\u00a0 It means that I too will have to die one day.\u201d\u00a0 The Buddha\u2019s intellect was so perceptive that one exposure to these facts of life made Him renounce worldly existence.\u00a0 Since we do not have such decisive intellects, we must repeatedly contemplate on these facts to allow the unattractiveness of the world to sink in.Non-attachment.\u00a0 It means dispassion toward the world.\u00a0 We have only one mind and if we wish to engage it in pursuing spiritual goals, we have to detach it from material objects and persons.\u00a0 The s\u0101dhak replaces worldly attachment with love and attachment toward God.\u00a0Absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on.\u00a0 These are areas where the mind easily becomes attached.\u00a0 In bodily thinking, one spontaneously identifies with the family and home as \u201cmine.\u201d\u00a0 Thus, they linger upon the mind more often and attachment to them shackles the mind to material consciousness.\u00a0 Attachment causes expectations of the kind of behavior we want from family members, and when these expectations are not met, it leads to mental anguish.\u00a0 Also inevitably, there is separation from the family, either temporarily, if they go to another place, or permanently, if they die.\u00a0 All these experiences and their apprehensions begin to weigh heavily upon the mind and drag it away from God.\u00a0 Hence, if we seek immortal bliss, we must practice prudence while interacting with the spouse, child, and home, to prevent the mind from becoming entangled.\u00a0 We must do our duty toward them, without attachment, as a nurse does her duty in the hospital, or as a teacher does her duty toward her students in the school.\u00a0Even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life.\u00a0 Pleasurable and painful events come without invitation, just as the night and the day.\u00a0 That is life.\u00a0 To rise above these dualities, we must learn to enhance our spiritual strength through detachment toward the world.\u00a0 We must develop the ability to remain unperturbed by life\u2019s reversals and also not get carried away with the euphoria of success.\u00a0Constant and exclusive devotion toward Me.\u00a0 Mere detachment means that the mind is not going in the negative direction.\u00a0 But life is more than merely preventing the undesirable.\u00a0 Life is about engaging in the desirable.\u00a0 The desirable goal of life is to consecrate it at the lotus feet of God.\u00a0 Therefore, Shree Krishna has highlighted it here.Inclination for solitary places.\u00a0 Unlike worldly people, devotees are not driven by the need for company to overcome feelings of loneliness.\u00a0 They naturally prefer solitude that enables them to engage their mind in communion with God.\u00a0 Hence, they are naturally inclined to choosing solitary places, where they are able to more deeply absorb themselves in devotional thoughts.\u00a0Aversion for mundane society.\u00a0 The sign of a materialistic mind is that it finds pleasure in talks about worldly people and worldly affairs.\u00a0 One who is cultivating divine consciousness develops a natural distaste for these activities, and thus avoids mundane society.\u00a0 At the same time, if it is necessary to participate in it for the sake of service to God, the devotee accepts it and develops the strength to remain mentally unaffected by it.Constancy in spiritual knowledge.\u00a0 To theoretically know something is not enough.\u00a0 One may know that anger is a bad thing but may still give vent to it repeatedly.\u00a0 We have to learn to practically implement spiritual knowledge in our lives.\u00a0 This does not happen by hearing profound truths just once.\u00a0 After hearing them, we must repeatedly contemplate upon them.\u00a0 Such mulling over the divine truths is the constancy in spiritual knowledge that Shree Krishna is talking about.Philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth.\u00a0 Even animals engage in the bodily activities of eating, sleeping, mating, and defending.\u00a0 However, God has especially blessed the human form with the faculty of knowledge.\u00a0 This is not to enable us to engage in bodily activities in a deluxe way, but for us to contemplate upon the questions: \u201cWho am I?\u00a0 Why am I here?\u00a0 What is my goal in life?\u00a0 How was this world created?\u00a0 What is my connection with the Creator?\u00a0 How will I fulfill my purpose in life?\u201d\u00a0 This philosophic pursuit of the truth sublimates our thinking above the animalistic level and brings us to hear and read about the divine science of God-realization.All the virtues, habits, behaviors, and attitudes described above lead to the growth of wisdom and knowledge.\u00a0 The opposite of these are vanity, hypocrisy, violence, vengeance, duplicity, disrespect for the Guru, uncleanliness of body and mind, unsteadiness, lack of self-control, longing for sense objects, conceit, entanglement in spouse, children, home, etc.\u00a0 Such dispositions cripple the development self-knowledge.\u00a0 Thus, Shree Krishna calls them ignorance and darkness.\u00a0\n", "next shlok": 13}
