    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now concludes His description of the field and the object of knowledge, by mentioning the fruit of knowing this topic.\u00a0 However, once again, He deems it fit to bring in devotion, and says that only the bhaktas (devotees) can truly understand this knowledge.\u00a0 Those who practice karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g, etc. devoid of bhakti cannot truly understand the import of the Bhagavad Gita, even though they themselves may think that they do.\u00a0 Bhakti is the essential ingredient in all paths leading to knowledge of God.\u00a0Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj puts this very nicely:jo hari sev\u0101 hetu ho, so\u012b karm bakh\u0101najo hari bhagati ba\u1e5bh\u0101ve, so\u012b samujhiya j\u00f1\u0101na(Bhakti \u015ahatak 66)\u00a0\u201cThat work which is done in devotion to God is the real karm; and that knowledge which increases love for God is real knowledge.\u201d\u00a0Devotion not only helps us to know God, it also makes the devotee godlike, and hence, Shree Krishna states that the devotees attain His nature.\u00a0 This has been emphasized in the Vedic scriptures again and again.\u00a0 The Vedas state:bhaktirevaina\u1e41 nayati bhaktirevaina\u1e41 pa\u015bhyati bhaktirevaina\u1e41 dar\u015bhayati bhakti va\u015bha\u1e25 puru\u1e63ho bhaktireva bh\u016byas\u012b\u00a0 (M\u0101\u1e6dhar \u015ahruti)\u201cBhakti alone can lead us to God.\u00a0 Bhakti alone can make us see God.\u00a0 Bhakti alone can bring us in the presence of God.\u00a0 God is under the control of bhakti.\u00a0 Hence, do bhakti exclusively.\u201d\u00a0 Again the Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had states:up\u0101sate puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 ye hyak\u0101m\u0101-ste \u015bhukrametadativartanti dh\u012br\u0101\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0 (3.2.1)\u201cThose who engage in bhakti toward the Supreme Divine Personality, giving up all material desires, escape the cycle of life and death.\u201d\u00a0 Yet again, the \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:yasya deve par\u0101 bhaktiryath\u0101 deve tath\u0101 gurautasyaite kathit\u0101 hyarth\u0101 prak\u0101\u015bhante mah\u0101tmana\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0 (6.23)\u201cThose who have unflinching bhakti toward God and identical bhakti toward the Guru, in the hearts of such saintly persons, by the grace of God the imports of the Vedic scriptures are automatically revealed.\u201d\u00a0 The other Vedic Scriptures also reiterate this emphatically:na s\u0101dhayati m\u0101\u1e41 yogo na s\u0101nkhya\u1e41 dharma uddhavana sv\u0101dhy\u0101yas tapas ty\u0101go yath\u0101 bhaktir mamorjit\u0101(Bhagavatam 11.14.20)Shree Krishna states: \u201cUddhav, I am not attained by a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog, by the study of s\u0101nkhya, cultivation of scriptural knowledge, austerities, nor by renunciation.\u00a0 It is by bhakti alone that I am won over.\u201d\u00a0 In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna repeatedly states this, in verses 8.22, 11.54, etc.\u00a0 In verse 18.55, He says:\u00a0 \u201cOnly by loving devotion to Me does one come to know who I am in Truth. Then, having come to know Me, My devotee enters into full consciousness of Me.\u201d\u00a0 The Ramayan also says:r\u0101mahi kevala premu pi\u0101r\u0101, j\u0101ni leu jo j\u0101nanih\u0101r\u0101.\u201cThe Supreme Lord Ram is only attained through love.\u00a0 Let this truth be known by all who care to know.\u201d\u00a0 Actually, this principle is emphasized in the other religious traditions as well.\u00a0 In the Jewish Torah it is written: \u201cYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might (Deuteronomy 6.5).\u00a0 Jesus of Nazareth repeats this commandment in the Christian New Testament as one of the first and foremost commandments to follow (Mark 12.30)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guru Granth Sahib states:hari sama jaga maha\u00f1 vastu nahi\u1e45, prem panth so\u00f1 panthasadguru sama sajjan nah\u012b\u00f1, g\u012bt\u0101 sama nahi\u00f1 grantha\u201cThere is no personality like God; there is no path equal to the path of devotion; there is no human equal to the Guru; and there is no scripture that can compare with the Gita.\u201d\n",

Without bhakti (devotion), practicing other paths like karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, or a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g cannot lead to true understanding. Devotion not only helps us know God but also makes the devotee godlike. The devotees attain the nature of God. This emphasis on devotion is repeated in the Vedic scriptures, stating that only bhakti can lead us to God and make us see Him. The scriptures also mention that those with unflinching bhakti towards God and the Guru have the imports of the Vedic scriptures revealed to them. Shree Krishna repeatedly states in the Bhagavad Gita that He can only be attained through bhakti. Other religious traditions also emphasize the importance of love and devotion to God. The Guru Granth Sahib affirms that there is no personality like God, no path equal to the path of devotion, no human equal to the Guru, and no scripture that can compare with the Gita.",
