    "newest_commentary": "The commentary explains the concept of God in the Bhagavad Gita, emphasizing that God is beyond human comprehension. It references a Vedic Mantra that describes God as being both near and far, inside everything and outside everything. This suggests that God's existence transcends our understanding. While earlier in the text, Krishna stated that knowing God is true knowledge, he now asserts that God is incomprehensible to the senses, mind, and intellect. This is because the intellect is material and cannot reach the Divine. However, if God grants His grace to someone, that person can come to know Him. Thus, the commentary highlights the paradoxical nature of understanding God in the Bhagavad Gita."
