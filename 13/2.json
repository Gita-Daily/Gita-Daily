    "newest_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna explains the distinction between the body and spirit. The soul, which is divine, does not directly engage in sensory activities but works through the body-mind-intellect mechanism. This mechanism is compared to a field of activities or energy. Although the soul is distinct from the body-mind-intellect, it identifies with these material entities due to forgetting its divine nature. The soul is called the knower of the body because it possesses knowledge of the body. This terminology is provided by self-realized sages who perceive their separate identity from the body. "
