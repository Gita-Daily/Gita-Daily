    "commentary": "\nIn the mode of goodness, the miseries of material existence reduce, and worldly desires become subdued. This gives rise to a feeling of contentment with one\u2019s condition. This is a good thing, but it can have a negative side too. For instance, those who experience pain in the world and are disturbed by the desires in their mind feel impelled to look for a solution to their problems, and this impetus sometimes brings them to the spiritual path. However, those in goodness can easily become complacent and feel no urge to progress to the transcendental platform. Also, sattva gu\u1e47a illumines the intellect with knowledge. If this is not accompanied by spiritual wisdom, then knowledge results in pride and that pride comes in the way of devotion to God. This is often seen in the case of scientists, academicians, scholars, etc. The mode of goodness usually predominates in them, since they spend their time and energy cultivating knowledge. And yet, the knowledge they possess often makes them proud, and they begin to feel that there can be no truth beyond the grasp of their intellect. Thus, they find it difficult to develop faith toward either the scriptures or the God-realized Saints.In the mode of passion, the souls are impelled toward intense activity. Their attachment to the world and preference for pleasure, prestige, wealth, and bodily comforts, propels them to work hard in the world for achieving these goals, which they consider to be the most important in life. Rajo gu\u1e47a increases the attraction between man and woman, and generates k\u0101m (lust). To satiate that lust, man and woman enter into the relationship of marriage and have a home. The upkeep of the home creates the need for wealth, so they begin to work hard for economic development. They engage in intense activity, but each action creates karmas, which further bind them in material existence.The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect of the living being. The desire for happiness now manifests in perverse manners. For example, everyone knows that cigarette smoking is injurious to health. Every cigarette pack carries a warning to that extent issued by the government authorities. Cigarette smokers read this, and yet do not refrain from smoking. This happens because the intellect loses its discriminative power and does not hesitate to inflict self-injury to get the pleasure of smoking. As someone jokingly said, \u201cA cigarette is a pipe with a fire at one end and a fool at the other.\u201d That is the influence of tamo gu\u1e47a, which binds the soul in the darkness of ignorance.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains the influence of the three modes of material nature - goodness, passion, and ignorance - on human behavior and spiritual progress. In the mode of goodness, worldly desires decrease and contentment arises. However, complacency and intellectual pride can hinder spiritual growth. The mode of passion drives intense activity and pursuit of worldly goals, creating attachments and binding karmic reactions. The mode of ignorance clouds the intellect, leading to perverse desires and self-destructive actions. The commentary emphasizes that the mode of goodness alone is not sufficient for spiritual advancement as it can foster arrogance and lack of faith. It highlights the need for spiritual wisdom and devotion to God beyond intellectual knowledge. The negative consequences of the modes of passion and ignorance are also explained, including the harmful effects of attachment, lust, and self-destructive habits. Overall, the commentary provides insights into the influence of the three modes on human behavior and the importance of spiritual enlightenment for true happiness and liberation.",
