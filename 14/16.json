    "translation": "The fruit of good action, they say, is Sattvic and pure, verily the fruit of Rajas is pain, and ignorance is the fruit of Tamas.",
    "commentary": "\nThose influenced by sattva are equipped with a measure of purity, virtue, knowledge, and selflessness. Hence, their actions are performed with a relatively pure intention and the results are uplifting and satisfying. Those influenced by rajas are agitated by the desires of their senses and mind. The intention behind their works is primarily self-aggrandizement and sense-gratification for themselves and their dependents. Thus, their works lead to the enjoyment of sense pleasures, which further fuels their sensual desires. Those who are predominated by tamas have no respect for scriptural injunctions and codes of conduct. They commit sinful deeds to relish perverse pleasures, which only result in further immersing them in delusion.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, the influence of sattva, rajas, and tamas is explained. Those influenced by sattva possess purity, virtue, knowledge, and selflessness. Their actions are performed with a pure intention, resulting in uplifting and satisfying outcomes. Individuals driven by rajas are driven by desires, seeking self-aggrandizement and sense-gratification. Their actions lead to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures, intensifying their desires. In contrast, individuals dominated by tamas disregard scriptural guidelines and engage in sinful actions for perverse enjoyment. These actions only deepen their delusion and disconnect from righteousness."
