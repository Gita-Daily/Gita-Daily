Sattva gu\u1e47a leads to the development of virtues and the illumination of knowledge. Rajo gu\u1e47a leads to greed, inordinate activity for worldly attainments, and restlessness of the mind. Tamo gu\u1e47a results in delusion of the intellect, laziness, and inclination toward intoxication and violence.In fact, these modes even influence our attitudes toward God and the spiritual path. To give an example, when the mode of goodness becomes prominent in the mind, we may start thinking, \u201cI have received so much grace from my Guru. I should endeavor to progress rapidly in my s\u0101dhan\u0101, since the human form is precious and it should not be wasted in mundane pursuits.\u201d When the mode of passion becomes prominent, we may think, \u201cI must surely progress on the spiritual path, but what is the hurry? At present, I have many responsibilities to discharge, and they are more important.\u201d When the mode of ignorance dominates, we could think, \u201cI am not really sure if there is any God or not, for no one has ever seen him. So why waste time in s\u0101dhan\u0101?\u201d Notice how the same person\u2019s thoughts have oscillated from such heights to the depths of devotion.For the mind to fluctuate due to the three gu\u1e47as is very natural. However, we are not to be dejected by this state of affairs, rather, we should understand why it happens and work to rise above it. S\u0101dhan\u0101 means to fight with the flow of the three gu\u1e47as in the mind, and force it to maintain the devotional feelings toward God and Guru. If our consciousness remained at the highest consciousness all day, there would be no need for s\u0101dhan\u0101. Though the mind\u2019s natural sentiments may be inclined toward the world, yet with the intellect, we have to force it into the spiritual realm. Initially, this may seem difficult, but with practice it becomes easy. This is just as driving a car is difficult initially, but with practice it becomes natural.Shree Krishna now begins to explain the destinations bestowed by the three gu\u1e47as, and the need for making it our goal to transcend them.\n", "next shlok": 14}
