    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna explains that the reincarnation of the souls in their next birth is linked to the gu\u1e47as that predominates their personality. Upon completion of their sojourn in the present life, the souls reach the kind of place that corresponds to their gu\u1e47as. This can be compared to students applying for college admission after completing school. There are many colleges in the country. Those students with good qualifying criteria at the school level gain admission in the best colleges, while those with poor grades and other scores are admitted to the worst ones.

Just as students with good grades get admitted to the best colleges, souls with sattva gu\u1e47a reach higher celestial abodes, souls with rajo gu\u1e47a return to the earth planet, and souls with tamo gu\u1e47a go to the nether worlds. Those who are transcendental to the three modes attain Krishna."
