    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna assures Arjun that those who equip themselves with the knowledge he is about to bestow will no longer have to accept repeated confinement in a mother\u2019s womb. They will also not be obliged to stay in a state of suspended animation in the womb of God at the time of the universal dissolution, or be reborn along with the next creation. The three gu\u1e47as (modes of material nature) are indeed the cause of bondage, and knowledge of them will illumine the path out of bondage.Shree Krishna repeatedly uses the strategy of proclaiming the results of what he is about to teach, to bring his student to rapt attention. The words na vyathanti mean \u201cthey will not experience misery.\u201d The word s\u0101dharmyam means they will acquire \u201ca similar divine nature\u201d as God himself. When the soul is released from the bondage of the material energy, it comes under the dominion of God\u2019s divine Yogmaya energy. The divine energy equips it with God\u2019s divine knowledge, love, and bliss. As a result, the soul becomes of the nature of God\u2014it acquires divine godlike qualities.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna assures Arjun that those who acquire his knowledge will be freed from the cycle of birth and death. They will not be confined in the womb or reborn with the next creation. Knowledge of the three modes of material nature will lead to liberation. Shree Krishna highlights the benefits of his teachings to capture Arjun's attention, promising that they will not experience misery and will acquire a divine nature similar to God's. When the soul is released from material bondage, it comes under God's divine energy and possesses divine knowledge, love, and bliss, becoming like God."
