    "commentary": "\nHaving mentioned the variation in the results that accrue from the three gu\u1e47as, Shree Krishna now gives the reason for this. Sattva gu\u1e47a gives rise to wisdom, which confers the ability to discriminate between right and wrong. It also pacifies the desires of the senses for gratification, and creates a concurrent feeling of happiness and contentment. People influenced by it are inclined toward intellectual pursuits and virtuous ideas. Thus, the mode of goodness promotes wise actions. Rajo gu\u1e47a inflames the senses, and puts the mind out of control, sending it into a spin of ambitious desires. The living being is trapped by it and over-endeavors for wealth and pleasures that are meaningless from the perspective of the soul. Tamo gu\u1e47a covers the living being with inertia and nescience. Shrouded in ignorance, a person performs wicked and impious deeds and bears consequent results.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "In this commentary, Lord Krishna explains the reason behind the variation in results caused by the three modes of material nature. Sattva guna, the mode of goodness, brings wisdom and the ability to discern right from wrong. It creates a sense of contentment and promotes virtuous actions. Rajo guna, the mode of passion, inflames the senses and leads the mind astray with ambitious desires. It traps the living being in pursuit of meaningless wealth and pleasures. Tamo guna, the mode of ignorance, envelops the living being with inertia and ignorance. Ignorant individuals perform wicked deeds and suffer the consequences. The different gunas influence human behavior and determine the outcomes of their actions."
