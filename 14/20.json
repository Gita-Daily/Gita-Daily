    "commentary": "\nIf we drink water from a dirty well, we are bound to get a stomach upset. Similarly, if we are influenced by the three modes, we are bound to experience their consequences, which are repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These four are the primary miseries of material life. It was by seeing these that the Buddha first realized that the world is a place of misery, and then searched for the way out of misery.The Vedas prescribe a number of codes of conduct, social duties, rituals, and regulations for human beings. These prescribed duties and codes of conduct are together called karm dharma, or var\u1e47\u0101\u015bhram dharma, or \u015bh\u0101r\u012brik dharma. They help elevate us from tamo gu\u1e47a and rajo gu\u1e47a to sattva gu\u1e47a. However, to reach sattva gu\u1e47a is not enough; it is also a form of bondage. The mode of goodness can be equated to being fettered with chains of gold. Our goal lies even beyond it\u2014to get out of the prison house of material existence.Shree Krishna explains that when we transcend the three modes, then Maya no longer binds the living being. Thus, the soul gets released from the cycle of life and death and attains immortality. Factually, the soul is always immortal. However, its identification with the material body makes it suffer the illusion of birth and death. This illusory experience is against the eternal nature of the soul, which seeks release from it. Hence, the material illusion is naturally discomforting to our inner being and, from within, we all seek the taste of immortality.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary highlights the consequences of being influenced by the three modes: repeated birth within the material realm, disease, old age, and death. These miseries were recognized by Buddha, who sought the way out. The Vedas prescribe various codes of conduct and duties to elevate us from lower modes to goodness. However, even goodness is a form of bondage. Shree Krishna explains that transcending the modes releases the soul from Maya and the cycle of life and death, leading to immortality. The soul, inherently immortal, suffers the illusion of birth and death due to its identification with the material body. This illusory experience is contrary to the soul's eternal nature and creates a longing for release and immortality."
