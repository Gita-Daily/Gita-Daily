    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now explains the working of rajo gu\u1e47a, and how it binds the soul to material existence. The Pata\u00f1jali Yog Dar\u015bhan describes material activity as the primary manifestation of rajo gu\u1e47a. Here, Shree Krishna describes its principal manifestation as attachment and desire.\nThe mode of passion fuels the lust for sensual enjoyment. It inflames desires for mental and physical pleasures. It also promotes attachment to worldly things. Persons influenced by rajo gu\u1e47a get engrossed in worldly pursuits of status, prestige, career, family, and home. They look on these as sources of pleasure and are motivated to undertake intense activity for the sake of these. In this way, the mode of passion increases desires, and these desires further fuel an increase of the mode of passion. They both nourish each other and trap the soul in worldly life.\nThe way to break out of this is to engage in karm yog, i.e. to begin offering the results of one\u2019s activities to God. This creates detachment from the world, and pacifies the effect of rajo gu\u1e47a.\n",
