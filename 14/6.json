    "translation": "\n\nBG 14.6:\r\n                            Amongst these, sattva gu\u1e47a, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating and full of well-being. O sinless one, it binds the soul by creating attachment for a sense of happiness and knowledge.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe word prak\u0101\u015bhakam means \u201cilluminating.\u201d The word an\u0101mayam means \u201chealthy and full of well-being.\u201d By extension, it also means \u201cof peaceful quality,\u201d devoid of any inherent cause for pain, discomfort, or misery. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating. Thus, sattva gu\u1e47a engenders virtue in one\u2019s personality and illuminates the intellect with knowledge. It makes a person become calm, satisfied, charitable, compassionate, helpful, serene, and tranquil. It also nurtures good health and freedom from sickness. While the mode of goodness creates an effect of serenity and happiness, attachment to them itself binds the soul to material nature.Let us understand this through an example. A traveler was passing through a forest, when three robbers attacked him. The first said, \u201cLet us kill him and steal all his wealth.\u201d The second said, \u201cNo, let us not kill him. We will simply bind him, and take away his possessions.\u201d Following the advice of the second robber, they tied him up in ropes and stole his wealth. When they had gone some distance away, the third robber returned. He opened the ropes of the traveler, and took him to the edge of the forest. He showed the way out, and said, \u201cI cannot go out myself, but if you follow this path, you will be able to get out of the forest.\u201dThe first robber was tamo gu\u1e47a, the mode of ignorance, which literally wants to kill the soul, by degrading it into sloth, languor, and nescience. The second robber was rajo gu\u1e47a, the mode of passion, which excites the passions of the living being, and binds the soul in innumerable worldly desires. The third robber was sattva gu\u1e47a, the mode of goodness, which reduces the vices of the living being, eases the material discomfort and puts the soul on the path of virtue. Yet, even sattva gu\u1e47a is within the realm of material nature. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use it to step up to the transcendental platform.Beyond these three, is \u015bhuddha sattva, the transcendental mode of goodness. It is the mode of the divine energy of God that is beyond material nature. When the soul becomes God-realized, by his grace, God bestows \u015bhuddha sattva upon the soul, making the senses, mind, and intellect divine.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the mode of goodness, known as sattva gu\u1e47a, brings serenity, virtue, and knowledge. It cultivates qualities like calmness, satisfaction, charity, compassion, and tranquility, promoting good health and freedom from sickness. However, attachment to these qualities binds the soul to material nature. The commentary uses an example of three robbers to illustrate the different modes of nature. The first robber represents the mode of ignorance (tamo gu\u1e47a), the second robber represents the mode of passion (rajo gu\u1e47a), and the third robber represents the mode of goodness. Nevertheless, even sattva gu\u1e47a is part of material nature and should not be attached to. Beyond these modes is \u015bhuddha sattva, the transcendental mode of goodness, which is divine and beyond material nature. When the soul attains God-realization, it receives the grace of God and elevates to a divine level."
