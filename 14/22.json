    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now clarifies the traits of those who have transcended the three gu\u1e47as. They are not disturbed when they see the gu\u1e47as functioning in the world, and their effects manifesting in persons, objects, and situations around them. Illumined persons do not hate ignorance when they see it, nor get implicated in it. Worldly-minded become overly concerned with the condition of the world. They spend their time and energy brooding about the state of things in the world. The enlightened souls also strive for human welfare, but they do so because it is their nature to help others. At the same time, they realize that the world is ultimately in the hands of God. They simply have to do their duty to the best of their ability, and leave the rest in the hands of God. Having come into God\u2019s world, our first duty is how to purify ourselves. Then, with a pure mind, we will naturally do good and beneficial works in the world, without allowing worldly situations to bear too heavily upon us. As Mahatma Gandhi said: \u201cBe the change that you wish to see in the world.\u201d\nShree Krishna explains that persons of illumination, who know themselves to be transcendental to the functioning of the modes, are neither miserable nor jubilant when the modes of nature perform their natural functions in the world. In fact, even when they perceive these gu\u1e47as in their mind, they do not feel disturbed. The mind is made from the material energy, and thus contains the three modes of Maya. So it is natural for the mind to be subjected to the influence of the gu\u1e47as, and their corresponding thoughts. The problem is that in bodily consciousness we do not see the mind as different from ourselves. And so, when the mind presents a disturbing thought, we feel, \u201cOh! I am thinking in this negative manner.\u201d We begin to associate with the poisonous thoughts, allowing them to reside in us and damage us spiritually. To the extent that even if the mind presents a thought against God and Guru, we accept the thought as ours. If, at that time, we could see the mind as separate from us, we would be able to dissociate ourselves from negative thoughts. We would then reject the thoughts of the mind, \u201cI will have nothing to do with any thought that is not conducive to my devotion.\u201d Persons on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from all negative thoughts arising in the mind from the flow of the gu\u1e47as.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that enlightened individuals who have transcended the three modes of nature are not disturbed by the functioning of these modes in the world. They work for the welfare of others but understand that the world is ultimately controlled by God. Their duty is to purify themselves and maintain a pure mind to perform good deeds without being affected by worldly situations. The commentary emphasizes the importance of separating oneself from negative thoughts influenced by the modes of nature. Those on the transcendental platform have mastered the art of distancing themselves from such thoughts.",
    "newest_commentary": "Enlightened individuals, unaffected by the three modes of nature, work for others' welfare and know that the world is under God's control. They purify themselves, maintain a pure mind, and perform good deeds without being affected by worldly situations. Separating from negative thoughts influenced by nature's modes is crucial for those on the transcendental platform."
