    "commentary": "\nHaving explained the traits of those who are situated beyond the three gu\u1e47as, Shree Krishna now reveals the one and only method of transcending these modes of material nature. The above verse indicates that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction with the body is not enough. With the help of bhakti yog, the mind has to be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna. Then alone will the mind become nirgu\u1e47a (untouched by the three modes), just as Shree Krishna is nirgu\u1e47a.Many people are of the view that if the mind is fixed upon the personal form of God, it will not rise to the transcendental platform. Only when it is attached to the formless Brahman, will the mind become transcendental to the modes of material nature. However, this verse refutes such a view. Although the personal form of God possesses infinite gu\u1e47as (qualities), these are all divine and beyond the modes of material nature. Hence, the personal form of God is also nirgu\u1e47a (beyond the three material modes). Sage Ved Vyas explains how the personal form of God is nirgu\u1e47a:yastu nirgu\u1e47a ityukta\u1e25 \u015bh\u0101stre\u1e63hu jagad\u012b\u015bhvara\u1e25pr\u0101k\u1e5bitairheya sanyuktairgu\u1e47airh\u012bnatvamuchyate (Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47)[v3]\u201cWherever the scriptures refer to God as nirgu\u1e47a (without attributes), they mean that he is without material attributes. Nevertheless, his divine personality is not devoid of qualities\u2014he possesses infinite divine attributes.\u201dThis verse also reveals the proper object of meditation. Transcendental meditation does not mean to meditate upon nothingness. The entity transcendental to the three modes of material nature is God. And so, only when the object of our meditation is God can it truly be called transcendental meditation.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, it is explained that mere knowledge of the self and its distinction from the body is not enough. Through bhakti yoga, the mind must be fixed on the Supreme Lord, Shree Krishna, to transcend the modes of material nature. Many believe that fixing the mind on the personal form of God will hinder spiritual progress, but this verse refutes that view. The personal form of God, although possessing infinite qualities, is beyond the material modes. It is clarified that when scriptures refer to God as nirguna, it means he is without material attributes but not devoid of divine qualities. The proper object of transcendental meditation is God, not nothingness. Only by meditating on God can one achieve true transcendence.",
