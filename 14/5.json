Although it is divine, its identification with the body ties it to material nature. The material energy possess three gu\u1e47as\u2014goodness, passion, and ignorance. Hence the body, mind, and intellect that are made from prak\u1e5biti also possess these three modes.Consider the example of three-color printing. If any one of the colors is released in excess by the machine on the paper, then the picture acquires a hue of that color. Similarly, prak\u1e5biti has the ink of the three colors. Based upon one\u2019s internal thoughts, the external circumstances, past sansk\u0101rs, and other factors, one or the other of these modes becomes dominant for that person. And the mode that predominates creates its corresponding shade upon that person\u2019s personality. Hence, the soul is swayed by the influence of these dominating modes. Shree Krishna now describes the impact of these modes upon the living being.\n",
