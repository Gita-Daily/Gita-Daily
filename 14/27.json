It was previously stated that the all-powerful God has both aspects to his personality\u2014the formless and the personal form. Here, Shree Krishna reveals that the Brahman which the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs worship is the light from the personal form of God. Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:yannakhenduruchirbrahma dhyeya\u1e41 brahm\u0101dibhi\u1e25 surai\u1e25gu\u1e47atrayamat\u012bta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 vande v\u1e5bind\u0101vane\u015bhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60)[v4]\u201cThe light that emanates from the toe nails of the feet of the Lord of Vrindavan, Shree Krishna, is the transcendental Brahman that the j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs and even the celestial gods meditate upon.\u201d Similarly, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:t\u0101\u00f1h\u0101ra a\u1e45gera \u015bhuddha kira\u1e47a-ma\u1e47\u1e0dalaupani\u1e63hat kahe t\u0101\u00f1re brahma sunirmala(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela 2.12) [v5]\u201cThe effulgence emanating from the divine body of God is described by the Upani\u1e63hads as Brahman.\u201d Thus, in this verse, Shree Krishna unequivocally confirms that the panacea for the disease of the three gu\u1e47as is to engage in unwavering devotion to the personal form of the Supreme Lord.\n", "next shlok": 28}
