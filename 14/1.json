He had also elucidated that prak\u1e5biti (material nature) is responsible for creating the field of activities for the puru\u1e63h (soul). He added that this does not happen independently, but under the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is also seated within the body of the living being. In this chapter, he goes on to elaborate in detail about the three-fold qualities of material nature (the gu\u1e47as). By gaining this knowledge and imbibing it into our consciousness as realized wisdom, we can ascend to the highest perfection.\n", "next shlok": 2}
