All the living entities in the world are under the grip of the three gu\u1e47as, and hence the gu\u1e47as are the active agents in all the works being done in the world. But the Supreme Lord is beyond them. Therefore, he is called tri-gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bt (transcendental to the modes of material nature). Similarly, all the attributes of God\u2014his names, forms, virtues, pastimes, abodes, saints\u2014are also tri-gu\u1e47\u0101t\u012bt.If we attach our mind to any personality or object within the realm of the three gu\u1e47as, it results in increasing their corresponding color on our mind and intellect. However, if we attach our mind to the divine realm, it transcends the gu\u1e47as and becomes divine. Those who understand this principle start loosening their relationship with worldly objects and people, and strengthening it, through bhakti, with God and the Guru. This enables them to transcend the three gu\u1e47as, and attain the divine nature of God. This is further elaborated in verse 14.26.\n", "next shlok": 20}
