    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now explains how the same individual\u2019s temperament oscillates amongst the three gu\u1e47as. These three gu\u1e47as are present in the material energy, and our mind is made from the same energy. Hence, all the three gu\u1e47as are present in our mind as well. They can be compared to three wrestlers competing with each other. Each keeps throwing the others down, and so, sometimes the first is on top, sometimes the second, and sometimes the third. In the same manner, the three gu\u1e47as keep gaining dominance over the individual\u2019s temperament, which oscillates amongst the three modes. Depending upon the external environment, the internal contemplation, and the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) of past lives, one or the other gu\u1e47a begins to dominate. There is no rule for how long it stays\u2014one gu\u1e47a may dominate the mind and intellect for as short as a moment or for as long as an hour.If sattva gu\u1e47a dominates, one becomes peaceful, content, generous, kind, helpful, serene, and tranquil. When rajo gu\u1e47a gains prominence, one becomes passionate, agitated, ambitious, envious of others success, and develops a gusto for sense pleasures. When tamo guna becomes prominent, one is overcome by sleep, laziness, hatred, anger, resentment, violence, and doubt.For example, let us suppose you are sitting in your library, engaged in study. There is no worldly disturbance, and your mind has become s\u0101ttvic. After finishing your study, you sit in your living room and switch on the television. Seeing all the images makes your mind r\u0101jasic, and increases your hankering for sense pleasures. While you are watching your favorite channel, your family member comes and changes the channel. This disturbance causes tamo gu\u1e47a to increase in your mind, and you are filled with anger. In this way, the mind sways amongst the three gu\u1e47as and adopts their qualities.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna explains how an individual's temperament oscillates among the three gunas - sattva, rajas, and tamas. These gunas exist in both the material energy and the mind, resembling three wrestlers competing for dominance. The gunas gain control over the individual's temperament based on external factors, internal contemplation, and past tendencies. Sattva guna brings peace, contentment, kindness, and serenity. Rajas guna leads to passion, ambition, envy, and a desire for sensory pleasures. Tamas guna results in sleepiness, laziness, anger, and doubt. The mind's shift between these gunas is illustrated with an example of studying in a serene library (sattva), switching to watching TV (rajas), and being interrupted and angered by a family member (tamas). Thus, the mind is influenced by and adopts the qualities of these gunas.",
