The soul itself is the Ultimate Reality, and once we understand that, all illusions shall dispel. However, this theory is negated by the Bhagavad Gita in this verse. Shree Krishna has already stated that Maya is an extension of His energy and not an illusion. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had also states:\u00a0m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 tu prak\u1e5biti\u1e41 vidy\u0101nm\u0101yina\u1e41 tu mahe\u015bhvaram\u00a0\u00a0 (4.10)\u201cMaya is the energy (prak\u1e5biti), while God is the Energetic.\u201d\u00a0The Ramayan states:\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0so d\u0101s\u012b raghub\u012bra ki samujhe\u1e45 mithy\u0101 sopi\u201cSome people think Maya is mithy\u0101 (non-existent), but factually it is an energy engaged in the service of God.\u201d\u00a0Shree Krishna has mentioned here that because Maya is His energy, it is difficult to overcome. If someone claims they have defeated Maya, that would mean they have defeated God. No one can conquer God; therefore, Maya is equally invincible. The human mind is made of Maya merely by self-effort no yogi, j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b, ascetic, or karm\u012b can successfully control the mind.\u00a0One could then ask, \u201cIs it impossible to overcome Maya?\u201d The second line of this verse has the answer to this question. Shree Krishna says, \u201cThose who surrender themselves to Me, the Supreme Lord, then by My grace, they would smoothly cross the ocean of material existence. I will instruct Maya to leave this soul, now that it has become Mine.\u201d On God\u2019s instructions Maya, the material energy of God, simply releases the surrendered soul from its clutches. It says, \u201cMy job is to keep troubling the soul until it surrenders at the feet of God; once the soul reaches there, my job is complete.\u201dHere is an example from everyday life. Assume that you visit a friend who has a large house, outside on the gate, a board says, \u201cBeware of dog.\u201d When you look inside, a trained guard dog is standing on the lawn. As soon as it spots you, it starts growling menacingly, scared; you decide to take the back gate. But even before you reach the back of the house, it is waiting there for you and snarls furiously, as if saying, \u201cYou dare step into this house.\u201d You have no choice, and you shout your friend\u2019s name aloud. Hearing all the commotion, your friend comes and finds you at the gate troubled by his dog. He sternly says to the dog, \u201cNo, Tommy, that is a friend, we need to let him in, come and sit down here.\u201d Hearing his master\u2019s command, the dog silently goes and sits near him. You can now open the gate and let yourself in without fear.In the same way, we are in the clutches of Maya, the material energy. Although it is subservient to God, it keeps troubling us so that we keep moving towards God. By our own efforts, we cannot defeat Maya; only when we surrender completely to God, by His grace, we can cross the ocean of material existence. The next question in our mind would be, \u201cIf it is so easy to defeat Maya, then why is it that most of us fail?\u201d Shree Krishna has elaborated on that in the next verse.\n", "next shlok": 15}
