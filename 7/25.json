    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna had mentioned two of His divine energies earlier in this chapter, in verses 7.4 and 7.5. The eight-fold prak\u1e5biti, or the material energy, and the\u00a0j\u012bva \u015bhakti, or the soul energy. Now, He talks about His third and the most powerful energy that is the Yogmaya.\u00a0 The Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:vi\u1e63h\u1e47u \u015bhakti\u1e25 par\u0101 prokt\u0101 k\u1e63hetraj\u00f1\u0101khy\u0101 tath\u0101 \u2019par\u0101avidy\u0101 karma sa\u1e41j\u00f1\u0101ny\u0101 t\u1e5bit\u012by\u0101 \u015bhaktiri\u1e63hyate(6.7.61) [v22]\u201cThe Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu has three main energies\u2014Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya.\u201dJagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u015bhaktim\u0101n k\u012b \u015bhaktiy\u0101\u00f1, aganita yadapi bakh\u0101natin maha\u00f1 \u2018m\u0101y\u0101, \u2018j\u012bva, aru, \u2018par\u0101, tri\u015bhakti pradh\u0101na(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 3) [v23]\u201cThe Supreme Energetic Shree Krishna has infinite energies. Amongst these,\u00a0Yogmaya, the souls, and Maya are the main ones.\u201dGod descends in this world by virtue of His Yogmaya energy and reveals His divine pastimes, His divine abode, His divine bliss and love on the Earth plane. However, the same Yogmaya power keeps His divinity veiled from us. We are unable to feel His presence, although He is seated in our hearts. Even in the present, if we are fortunate enough to see the Lord in His personal-form, we cannot recognize Him. Until we are eligible for His divine vision, the Yogmaya keeps God\u2019s divine form concealed from us. And only by God\u2019s grace, the Yogmaya bestows upon us the divine vision that allows us to recognize and see God.The Ramayan states:chid\u0101nandamaya deha tumh\u0101r\u012b, bigata bik\u0101ra j\u0101na adhik\u0101r\u012b\u00a0\u00a0[v24]\u201cO God, you have a divine form. Only those whose hearts are purified can know you by your grace.\u201dSimilar to God, His Yogmaya energy is both formless and manifests into personal forms. Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati. Durga, Kali, etc., are the divine forms of the Yogmaya energy of God. In the Vedic culture, all these forms are revered; as the Mother of the Universe. She radiates the motherly qualities of kindness, mercy, compassion, beauty, divine grace, and causeless love. Among these, the most important quality for us souls is Her divine grace with which we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. It is for the same reason, the devotees of Vrindavan sing, \u201cRadhe Radhe, Shyam se mil\u0101 de,\u201d\u00a0\u201cO Radha, please bestow your grace and help me meet Shree Krishna.\u201dTherefore, the same Yogmaya\u2013conceals God from the unqualified souls and bestows Her divine grace upon the surrendered souls, for they can know Him. However, those souls who are under the influence of Maya or the material energy turn their backs towards God. They remain bereft of the divine grace of His Yogmaya energy and continue living in ignorance, entangled in Maya. Others who have turned to God are in the shelter of Yogmaya and liberated from Maya.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, it is mentioned that Shree Krishna has three main energies: the material energy, the soul energy, and Yogmaya. Yogmaya is the most powerful energy and is responsible for revealing God's divine pastimes, abode, bliss, and love on Earth. However, Yogmaya also veils God's divinity from us, making it difficult to feel His presence. Only by God's grace and eligibility can we recognize and see Him. Yogmaya manifests in various forms such as Radha, Sita, Lakshmi, Parvati, Durga, and Kali, and radiates motherly qualities like kindness, mercy, and beauty. Through Yogmaya's divine grace, we can acquire transcendental knowledge to know God. Those who surrender to Yogmaya receive her grace and can know God, while those under the influence of Maya remain ignorant and entangled. Overall, Yogmaya conceals God from unqualified souls and liberates those who seek His shelter.",
