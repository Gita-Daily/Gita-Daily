The entire universe is an extension of His opulence. On Earth, He is the force behind both the non-living and the living. He is the mild and pure fragrance of the earth and the bright radiance of a flame. He is the life-force of all living creatures. The ascetics or sadhus consciously deny themselves of bodily pleasures and perform austerities for self-purification. Lord Krishna says He is indeed the force behind their capacity to do penance.\n", "next shlok": 10}
