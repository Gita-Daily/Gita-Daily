They neither seek pleasure in the material world nor feel an aversion for pain. They are cautious while indulging in worldly pleasures as it may again delude their soul. Earlier, in verse 2.69, Shree Krishna had said, \u201cWhat the ignorant consider as night, the wise consider as day.\u201d Such devotees, who aspire to attain God-realization, look upon adversities as an opportunity for spiritual growth and renunciation.\n", "next shlok": 29}
