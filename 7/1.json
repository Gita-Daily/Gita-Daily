    "newest_commentary": "In the previous chapter, Krishna emphasized the importance of exclusive devotion to God. Arjuna now wonders how to know the Supreme Lord and how to worship and meditate on Him. Though Arjuna hasn't asked these questions, Krishna, being all-knowing and compassionate, begins to answer. Krishna uses the terms 'with your mind focused on Me' and 'listen' to urge Arjuna to pay attention to His words. This sets the stage for Krishna's teachings on how to attain knowledge of God and engage in sincere devotion and meditation."
