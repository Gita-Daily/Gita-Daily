    "commentary": "\nIn a cause and effect relationship, every cause is the seed of its effect. For example, an ocean is the seed of the clouds, and the clouds are the seed for rain. Similarly, Shree Krishna says in this verse that He is the cause (the eternal seed) from which all beings manifest.Have you ever thought about why some people are more intelligent than others? Why do they have greater brilliance in their thoughts and ideas? The only explanation for this can be; since all that exists is a manifestation of God\u2019s energy. The splendid qualities visible in such outstanding people can only be due to God\u2019s grace. As Shree Krishna has mentioned in this verse, He is the subtle force behind the intelligent and the glorious. He makes their minds more analytic and thoughts scintillating.Legend of modern history, such as William Shakespeare, displayed unmatched brilliance in the field of literature. That could have only been possible by God\u2019s grace. His works have nourished English literature, and English has now become the most used language of the world. Swami Vivekananda once said: the British Empire has united the world in one language.\u00a0Another such genius is Bill Gates, who changed the course of information technology with his Windows Operating System. With more than ninety percent of market share, Windows has become the most popular Operating System in the world. As it is very user-friendly, it has made information technology available to the public at large. The usage of computers is not limited to IT engineers anymore. Such inspiration to have one major operating system to unify the information technology industry and ensure proper interaction could only be through God\u2019s plan. God enhances one such person\u2019s intellect when he wants to save us from chaos.Of course, the saints have always acknowledged that the brilliance and beauty of their works are due to God\u2019s special grace. Sage Tulsidas said:\u00a0\u00a0na mai\u00f1 kiy\u0101 na kari sakau\u00f1, sahiba kart\u0101 morkarata kar\u0101vata \u0101ap\u00a0hai\u00f1, tulas\u012b tulas\u012b \u015bhor\u201cNeither did I write the Ramayan, nor do I have the ability to write it.\u00a0 The Lord is my Doer.\u00a0 He directs my actions and acts through me, but the world thinks that Tulsidas is doing them.\u201d\u00a0 Therefore, Lord Shree Krishna is indeed the ultimate source of all the brilliance and intelligence that manifests around us.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary on the Bhagavad Gita explains the concept of cause and effect, stating that every cause is the seed of its effect. Shree Krishna emphasizes that He is the eternal cause from which all beings manifest. The author ponders why some people possess greater intelligence and brilliance, concluding that these exceptional qualities arise from God's grace. Examples of renowned individuals like William Shakespeare and Bill Gates are given as evidence of God's influence, as their remarkable achievements in literature and technology can only be attributed to divine intervention. The saints also acknowledge that their works are a result of God's special grace. Sage Tulsidas, for instance, humbly states that he is merely a vessel through which the Lord acts. In summary, Lord Shree Krishna is seen as the ultimate source of the brilliance and intelligence present in the world."
