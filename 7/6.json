In the material realm, all life is a combination of both matter and soul. Matter by itself is insentient or lifeless, and the sentient soul needs a carrier body. Hence, both come together to form a living being.Similarly, the entire creation is a manifestation of God\u2019s energies. One cycle of creation lasts for 100 years of Brahma. Then the Supreme Lord starts the process of dissolution. The five gross elements merge into five subtle elements, which in turn merge into ahank\u0101r. Ahank\u0101r goes back into mah\u0101n, which again unites with prak\u1e5biti.\u00a0 Prak\u1e5biti now resides inside the body of Maha Vishnu (another form of the Supreme Lord).\u00a0 All the materially bound souls, which could not get liberated during this cycle of creation, also reside in God\u2019s body. They remain unmanifested, waiting for the next cycle of creation.When God decides to create, the entire cycle begins all over again\u00a0(as explained in\u00a0verse 7.4),\u00a0and a new world comes into existence. Therefore, God is the source, the sustainer, and the resting place for the entire creation.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n", "next shlok": 7}
