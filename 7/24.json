    "commentary": "\nPeople often vehemently debate upon the Supreme Lord being a formless God, while the others claim He exists in His personal-form. Even those who agree to both aspects of God\u2019s personality are sometimes confused. Which of them precedes the other, and which of them is the original God? Did the personal form of God manifest from the formless, or is it the other way round? We have discussed this earlier in the commentary for Verse\u00a04.5.Here in this verse, Shree Krishna resolves this debate by stating that God exists in the spiritual realm eternally in His divine form. The ignorant do not understand the magnificent and imperishable nature of His personal-form. The divine personality of God has not manifested from the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The divine light that emanates from His transcendental body is the formless Brahman.The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:yannakhenduruchir brahma dhyeya\u1e41 brahm\u0101dibhi\u1e25 surai\u1e25gu\u1e47atrayamat\u012bta\u1e41 ta\u1e41 vande v\u1e5bind\u0101vane\u015bhvaram(Patal Khand 77.60) [v21]\u201cThe light that emanates from the toenails of God\u2019s personality is worshipped as\u00a0the Brahman\u00a0by the\u00a0j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs.\u201dTherefore, there is no difference between the two forms. Neither of them is superior or inferior. In God\u2019s personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, associates, etc., manifest as an extension of His divine energy. However, in the formless Brahman, even though all the divine potencies and energies exist, they are in a concealed form.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on verse 9.11 of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna resolves the debate on whether God is formless or has a personal form. He states that God exists eternally in His divine form in the spiritual realm. The ignorant fail to understand the imperishable nature of His personal-form. The divine personality of God is not a manifestation of the formless Brahman; it is primordial. The formless Brahman is the divine light emanating from His transcendental body. According to the Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47, the light from God's toenails is worshipped as the Brahman by the enlightened. Both the personal and formless aspects of God are equal in importance. In God's personal-form, His name, form, virtues, abode, pastimes, and associates manifest as an extension of His divine energy. On the other hand, in the formless Brahman, although all divine energies exist, they remain concealed.",
