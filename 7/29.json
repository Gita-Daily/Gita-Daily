    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna had mentioned earlier in verse 7.26 that no one can know God by the strength of their own intellect. However, in this verse, He says that God can be known\u2014only by virtue of His grace. Those devotees who surrender to Him completely\u2014receive His divine grace. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had states:n\u0101yam\u0101tm\u0101 pravachanena labhyo\u00a0 na medhay\u0101 na bahun\u0101 \u015bhrutenayamevai\u1e63ha v\u1e5bi\u1e47ute tena labhya-stasyai\u1e63ha \u0101tm\u0101 viv\u1e5bi\u1e47ute tan\u016b\u1e41 sv\u0101m(1.2.23) [v29]\u201cGod cannot be known\u2014through spiritual discourses nor the intellect nor hearing various kinds of teachings. Only when He bestows His grace upon someone does that fortunate soul come to know Him.\u201dThe Vedas state:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0ekasmin vij\u00f1\u0101te sarvamida\u1e41 vij\u00f1\u0101ta\u1e41 bhavati\u00a0 \u00a0[v30]\u201cIf you know God, you will know everything.\u201dAlthough some spiritual seekers consider\u00a0\u0101tma-j\u00f1\u0101na,\u00a0or knowledge of the self, as the ultimate goal of human birth, it is only a tiny drop in the ocean of knowledge, which is brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na\u00a0or the knowledge of God. By just knowing a drop, one cannot understand the enormity, depth, or prowess of the ocean. Therefore, \u0101tma-j\u00f1\u0101na cannot be in any way equal to brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na. However, it can be a starting point toward the absolute.According to the Vedas, absolute knowledge is\u2014the Knowledge of God. If you know God, everything related to Him; is also revealed, and all your ignorance disappears. Shree Krishna states that those who take His shelter are liberated from the cycle of birth and death forever. And by His divine grace, they receive brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na or knowledge of the Brahman, \u0101tma-j\u00f1\u0101na\u00a0or knowledge of the self and the entire field of karmic action or the divine laws of karma.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that God can only be known through His grace and not through intellectual strength. Those who completely surrender to Him receive His divine grace. Spiritual discourses, intellect, and teachings cannot lead to the knowledge of God; only His grace can bestow that knowledge upon someone. The ultimate goal of human birth is the knowledge of God, which surpasses the knowledge of the self. While self-knowledge is important, it is just a small part of the vast knowledge of God. Knowing God brings forth understanding of everything related to Him and dispels ignorance. Taking shelter in Krishna liberates one from the cycle of birth and death and grants knowledge of the Brahman, knowledge of the self, and knowledge of karmic action.",
