He is the Substratum over which this entire creation exists;\u00a0He is the Creator, Sustainer, and Annihilator.

By using the words, Me, My and I, He has dispelled the doubts that many have about Lord Shree Krishna Himself being God, the Supreme Lord. As many suppose that there is another higher formless entity, who is the ultimate source of even Lord Shree Krishna.
