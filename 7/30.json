    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna mentions that those enlightened souls who know Him are truly devoted to Him, and even at the time of their death, they are in full consciousness of Him. Such true devotees attain His divine abode. But how can one remember God even at the time of death? Death is said to be a very painful journey, comparable to 2000 scorpions biting at the same time. Such extreme pain is beyond the tolerance of any normal human; a person loses consciousness; the mind and the intellect stop working much before the end. One cannot remember anything in that state. Where is the question of remembering God? How do they do it then?Those enlightened beings who have attained true knowledge are ever filled with devotion to God, their mind and intellect, all surrendered and attached to Him alone. Thus, their bodies are beyond pleasure and pain even at the time of death. Their soul is completely disconnected from lamentation and hankering at the material level because it is no longer in bodily consciousness. \u00a0Shree Krishna has explained the words adhibh\u016bta, adhidaiva, and adhiyaj\u00f1a in the next chapter.\n",

While death is a painful journey, these devotees are able to overcome the extreme pain by surrendering their mind and intellect to God. Their bodies are beyond pleasure and pain because they are disconnected from bodily consciousness. They do not experience lamentation or attachment to material things. Shree Krishna further elaborates on the terms adhibh\u016bta, adhidaiva, and adhiyaj\u00f1a in the next chapter. The essence is that true devotion to God allows one to remember and remain connected to Him throughout life, even in the face of death.",
