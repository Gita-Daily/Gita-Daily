    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, God declares that He is trik\u0101l-dar\u015bh\u012b\u2014knower of the past, present, and the future. Most of us are forgetful of even what we were thinking a few hours ago; whereas, God is omniscient. He remembers and keeps a record of the deeds, words, and even the thoughts of each individual soul of the universe throughout their life and since their infinite lifetimes. God maintains this record of the sa\u00f1chit\u00a0karma or the stockpile of karmas of every soul for endless lifetimes because, as the governor of the law of karma, He dispenses justice to the souls.Shree Krishna says that He has the knowledge of everything, the past, present, and the future. However, with our finite intellect, we cannot know the Almighty God. His infinite glory, splendor, energies, qualities, and extent are beyond the comprehension of our inadequate intellect.The Vedic scriptures state:ya\u1e25 sarvaj\u00f1a\u1e25 sarvavidyasya j\u00f1\u0101namaya\u1e41 tapa\u1e25\u00a0 (Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had 1.1.9) [v25]\u201cGod is all-knowing and omniscient. His austerity consists of knowledge.\u201dnai\u1e63h\u0101 tarke\u1e47a matir\u0101paney\u0101\u00a0 (Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had 1.2.9) [v26]\u201cGod is beyond the scope of our intellectual logic.\u201dyato v\u0101cho nivartante apr\u0101pya manas\u0101 saha\u00a0 (Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had 2.9.1) [v27]\u201cGod cannot be described in words, nor can our mind comprehend Him.\u201dr\u0101m atarkya buddhi mana b\u0101n\u012b, mata ham\u0101ra asa sunahi say\u0101n\u012b\u00a0 (Ramayan) [v28]\u201cGod cannot be analyzed by arguments or formulated by words, mind, and intellect.\u201dOnly God knows Himself. However, if He finds some eligible soul, He bestows His grace upon that fortunate soul, and then with God\u2019s divine intellect, the soul gets to know God. Therefore, only by God\u2019s grace one can know God. Our material intellect does not have the capacity to know Him otherwise. The concept of God\u2019s grace is discussed again in detail in 10.11 and 18.56.\n",
