    "commentary": "\nIn the previous verse, Shree Krishna stated that the devotees situated in knowledge or j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b bhakt\u00a0are the highest. However, He clarifies in this verse that whatever may be the reason for their devotion, all His devotees are privileged; even the other three kinds are blessed souls. But the devotees seated in knowledge worship God selflessly, without expecting any material gains in return. Hence, the unconditional love of such selfless devotees even binds God.Worldly love; is driven by the desire for self-gratification. There is a give and take attitude, and there is an expectation of receiving something in return from the beloved. However, Par\u0101 bhakti or divine love is totally different. It is filled with the desire for the happiness of the Divine Beloved and sacrifice in His service. Divine love fosters a giving attitude without expecting anything in return.Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said:k\u0101mera t\u0101tparya nija-sambhoga kevalak\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-sukha-t\u0101tparya-m\u0101tra prema ta\u2019 prabalaataeva k\u0101ma-preme bahuta antarak\u0101ma andha-tama\u1e25, prema nirmala bh\u0101skara(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela, 4.166 & 171)[v16]\u201cLust (worldly love) exists for self-happiness; divine love is harbored for Shree Krishna\u2019s happiness. There is a tremendous difference between them\u2014lust is like darkness and ignorance, while divine love is pure and illuminating.\u201dJagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has very beautifully stated:brahma lok paryanta sukh, aru muktihu\u00f1 sukh ty\u0101g,tabai dharahu paga prema patha, nahi\u1e45 lagi jaihe\u00f1 d\u0101g.(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 45)[v17]\u201cGive up the desires for worldly pleasures and that of liberation if you wish to walk the path of devotion. Else the pure waters of divine love will get tainted with selfishness.\u201dSage Narad defined pure devotion in this manner:tat sukha sukhitvam\u00a0 \u00a0 (N\u0101rad Bhakti Dar\u015bhan,\u00a0S\u016btra\u00a024)[v18]\u201cTrue love is for the happiness of the Beloved.\u201d The materially motivated devotees cannot engage in such devotion, but the devotee who is in knowledge rises to this level of selflessness. When someone learns to love God in this manner, he becomes a slave of that Devotee. The highest quality of God is\u00a0bhakta vatsalt\u0101\u00a0(his love for his devotees).\u00a0The Pura\u1e47as state:g\u012btv\u0101 cha mama n\u0101m\u0101ni vicharenmama sannidhauiti brav\u012bmi te satya\u1e41 kr\u012btoha\u1e41 tasya ch\u0101rjuna\u00a0(\u0100di Pur\u0101\u1e47 1.2.231)[v19]Shree Krishna says: \u201cI become the slave of those devotees of mine, who chant my names and keep me close to them in their thoughts; this is a fact, O Arjun.\u201dIn this verse Shree Krishna goes to the extent of saying that bound by the devotion and love of His selfless devotees, He looks upon them as Himself.\n",
