This energy is completely transcendental as compared to the lifeless matter. It is His spiritual energy, the j\u012bva \u015bhakti, which includes all the living souls of the world. Now, He has moved from explaining material science toward the spiritual realm.Many great philosophers of India have given their perspectives and described the relationship between God and the j\u012bva, the individual soul.\u00a0 For example, the non-dualists state: j\u012bvo brahmaiva n\u0101para\u1e25 \u201cThe soul itself is God.\u201d\u00a0 But this concept gives rise to several questions, such as:How can the\u00a0soul itself be God? God is most powerful, and Maya is His subservient energy. The souls are always overpowered by; Maya. Then is Maya stronger than God?The individual soul is always; gripped by ignorance and misery. It needs a continuous reminder from the saints and scriptures, even about its existence and purpose. How can God, who is all-knowing, be considered a soul which is subject to ignorance?The Vedas repeatedly state that God is all-pervading in this world and beyond. Similarly, individual souls should also be able to exist anywhere at any given time. Then what about the question of going to heaven or hell after death?There is only one God, but the souls are countless. If the soul itself is God, then there should be many Gods. Therefore, the claims by non-dualistic philosophers that the soul itself is God are inconclusive.The dualist philosophers\u2019 state that the souls and God are separate. Even though it may answer some of the above questions, yet it is still an incomplete philosophy in light of what Shree Krishna states in this verse. He says that the soul is a part of j\u012bva \u015bhakti God\u2019s spiritual energy. And as explained earlier, Maya, the material energy, is also His subservient. Thus, God is supreme; He is the governor of both the lower material and the higher spiritual energies.\u00a0Now let us see what the scriptures and various saints have said:eka-de\u015bha-sthitasy\u0101gnir jyotsn\u0101 vist\u0101rin\u0323\u012b yath\u0101parasya brahman\u0323ah\u0323 \u015bhaktis tathedam akhila\u1e41 jagat\u00a0 (Vi\u1e63h\u1e47u Pur\u0101\u1e47 1.22.53)\u201cJust as the sun resides in one place but its sunlight pervades; the entire solar system. Similarly, there is one God, who by His infinite powers pervades the three worlds.\u201d\u00a0Chaitanya Mahaprabhu said: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0j\u012bva-tattva \u015bhakti, k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a-tattva \u015bhaktim\u0101ng\u012bt\u0101-vi\u1e63h\u1e47upur\u0101\u1e47\u0101di t\u0101h\u0101te pram\u0101\u1e47a\u00a0\u00a0 (Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, \u0100di Leela, 7.117)\u201cThe soul is the energy of God, while He is the Supreme Energetic.\u201dOnce we understand and accept that the soul is a small part of God\u2019s infinite energy, the concept of non-duality of the entire creation becomes clear. Energies can exist concurrently within the same energetic. For example, fire contains both heat and light, which are different entities and have different properties. But they are part of the same fire which emits them. Likewise, God as the Energetic and the souls His energy can be considered one. At the same time, due to their distinct properties, both entities are different from each other.\u00a0Jagadguru Kripaluji Maharaj has encapsulated and perfectly expressed Shree Krishna\u2019s statement in this and the previous verse:j\u012bvu\u2019 \u2018m\u0101y\u0101\u2019, dui \u015bhakti hai\u00f1, \u015bhaktim\u0101n bhagav\u0101n\u015bhaktihi\u00f1 bheda abheda bh\u012b, \u015bhaktim\u0101n te j\u0101n \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 42)\u201cThe soul and Maya are both energies of God.\u00a0 Hence, they are both one with God and also different from God.\u201dConsidering the unison of both; the Energetic and His energies, it is stated that God and His creation are non-different. The entire world is a veritable form of God.sarva\u1e41 khalvida\u1e41 brahma\u00a0\u00a0 (Chh\u0101ndogya Upani\u1e63had 3.14.1)\u201cAll is Brahman.\u201d\u012b\u015bh\u0101v\u0101syam idam sarva\u1e41\u00a0\u00a0 (\u012a\u015bhopani\u1e63had 1)\u201cEverything that exists in the world is God.\u201dpuru\u1e63ha eveda\u1e41 sarva\u1e41\u00a0\u00a0 (\u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had 3.15)\u201cThe Supreme Divine Personality is everything that exists.\u201dAccording to these Vedic verses, there is only one God and nothing else. Yet, when we consider the Energetic and energy concept, there is diversity within this unity and an incredible variety. God, the souls, and matter, all three are different entities with different properties. God is Supremely sentient; He is the source of both the souls and the matter. Yet, souls are sentient, and the matter insentient.The scriptures also state the existence of three entities in creation:k\u1e63hara\u1e41 pradh\u0101namam\u1e5bit\u0101k\u1e63hara\u1e41 hara\u1e25k\u1e63har\u0101tm\u0101n\u0101v\u012b\u015bhate deva eka\u1e25tasy\u0101bhidhy\u0101n\u0101d yojan\u0101t tattvabh\u0101vadbh\u016bya\u015bhch\u0101nte vi\u015bhwam\u0101y\u0101niv\u1e5bitti\u1e25\u00a0(\u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had 1.10)\u201cThere are three entities in existence: 1) Matter, which is perishable.\u00a0 2) The individual souls who are imperishable.\u00a0 3) God, who is the controller of both matter and the souls.\u00a0 By meditating upon God, uniting with Him, and becoming more like Him, the soul is free from the world\u2019s illusion.\u201dThe Vedas have expounded on both dualistic and non-dualistic concepts. Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has upheld the concepts of concurrent coherence, yet variance between the soul and God. This means God and the soul are one; yet, separate from each other.\n", "next shlok": 6}
