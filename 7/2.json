In contrast,\u00a0vij\u00f1\u0101na (wisdom) is the knowledge gained through spiritual practice, it is a direct experiential realization; and should not be misunderstood for intellectual knowledge. An example to explain this is honey kept in a sealed jar. We have heard that honey has the sweetest taste that is incomparable to any other sweet. But unless we open the jar and taste it, we will not get the experiential realization of its sweetness.Likewise, the Guru gives us j\u00f1\u0101na, which is the theoretical knowledge of the scriptures. Yet, we need to practice sadhana\u00a0as per the acquired j\u00f1\u0101na, which would consequently purify our mind. Only then, vij\u00f1\u0101na (wisdom) knowledge, through self-realization will be attained.Once Sage Ved Vyas intended to write the Shreemad Bhagavatam: a scripture that would describe God, His glories, nature, and as the object of devotion. But he did not wish to write it only based upon his j\u00f1\u0101na. Therefore, first he engaged himself\u00a0 in bhakti\u00a0to attain the experiential realization, which is vij\u00f1\u0101na. He wrote:bhakti-yogena manasi samyak pra\u1e47ihite \u2019male\u00a0apa\u015bhyat puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 p\u016brva\u1e41 m\u0101y\u0101\u1e41 cha tad-ap\u0101\u015bhray\u0101m(Bhagavatam 1.7.4)\u201cThrough bhakti-yog, Ved Vyas fixed his mind upon God without any material sentiments, and thus attained the complete vision and realization of the Supreme Divine Personality along with His external energy, Maya, which was under His control.\u201d\u00a0 Inspired by this realization, he wrote the epic scripture.In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna affirms\u00a0to Arjun that He will bestow upon him the theoretical knowledge regarding the Supreme Divine Personality. He will also illuminate his mind with the required wisdom. Once this knowledge is acquired, there will be nothing remaining for him to know.\n", "next shlok": 3}
