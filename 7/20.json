    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna says that people worship the devat\u0101s (celestial gods) as per the prescribed rituals to attain material gains. Material desires have shrouded their knowledge. Hence, they forget that the Supreme Lord is the source of all that exists, including these celestial gods. As a president of a country appoints his officers among different departments. Similarly, these celestial gods also occupy different positions in the working of God\u2019s creation. They derive their powers from God; they are not independent of Him. They can bestow on their devotees only material things that are under their control. But cannot liberate anyone from the bondage of Maya or the cycle of birth and death because; they themselves are not liberated from this cycle. God alone has the power to do so. The celestial gods are also souls like us. However, they have attained these positions in the celestial abodes as a result of their pious deeds from previous lives. Once their account of pious deeds depletes, they have to return to earth. Hence, even the celestial gods are perishable; God alone is eternal.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna explains that people worship celestial gods to fulfill their material desires, but they forget that God is the source of everything, including these gods. The celestial gods occupy different positions in God's creation and derive their powers from Him. However, they can only grant material blessings and cannot liberate people from the cycle of birth and death. They are also souls who have attained their positions based on past deeds and will return to earth once their merits are exhausted. Therefore, even the celestial gods are impermanent, while God alone is eternal.",
