    "commentary": "\nDesire is an active craving for things not attained. Fueled with passion, one achieves and experiences the desired objects. But this causes attachment, which is a passive mental emotion that provokes the thirst for more. Therefore, when Shree Krishna states k\u0101ma-r\u0101ga-vivarjitam; He means \u201cdevoid of passion and attachment.\u201d Explaining the nature of His strength, He says that He is the serene and sublime strength in people, which empowers them; to successfully fulfill their duties and responsibilities.\u00a0When sexual activity is undertaken only for sensual pleasure and is devoid of any regulative principles, it is considered beastly or animalistic. Whereas, it is regarded, in line with the scriptural injunctions and not a contrary virtue, when carried out for procreation by a householder. Here, Shree Krishna has mentioned that within the institution of marriage, He is the controlled, virtuous, and well-intended sexual activity of a householder.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Desire, fueled by passion, leads to attachment and the thirst for more. In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna emphasizes being devoid of passion and attachment. He explains that His strength is the serene and sublime force that empowers individuals to fulfill their duties. Sexual activity without regulative principles is considered beastly, while within the institution of marriage, it is seen as virtuous and well-intended. Shree Krishna asserts that He embodies the controlled and purposeful sexual activity of a householder."
