As per the Sanskrit dictionary, a few of them are: attainment of supernatural power, accomplishment, success, performance, fulfillment, solution of a problem, completion of cooking or a task, healing, hitting the mark, maturing, supreme felicity, beatitude, an unusual skill or faculty, perfection.In this verse, Shree Krishna has used siddhi for perfection in the spiritual path. He says, \u201cOnly a tiny portion of the innumerable souls are fortunate to get a human birth. Amongst them, only a minuscule strive for spiritual perfection. And even among those perfected souls, ones who are aware of My divine glories and paramount position are very rare.\u201d\u00a0How is it that even perfected souls are unable to know God? The reason is without bhakti or loving devotion, it is not possible to realize the Supreme. Spiritual aspirants of karm, j\u00f1\u0101na, ha\u1e6dha yog, etc., cannot know God unless they include devotion in their practice. \u00a0Shree Krishna has stated this fact several times in the Bhagavad Gita:\u201cThe Supreme Divine Personality is greater than all that exists. Although He is all-pervading and all living beings are situated in Him, yet He can be known only through devotion.\u201d\u00a0 BG 8.22.\u00a0\u201cO Arjun, by unalloyed devotion alone can I be known as I am, standing before you. Thereby, on receiving my divine vision, O scorcher of foes, one can enter into union with me.\u201d\u00a0 BG 11.54\u201cOnly by loving devotion to me does one come to know who I am in truth. Then, having come to know me, my devotee enters into full consciousness of me.\u201d\u00a0 BG 18.55\u00a0Therefore, such spiritual aspirants who do not include devotion in their sadhana attain only limited theoretical knowledge or j\u00f1\u0101na. And devoid of vij\u00f1\u0101na the experiential knowledge, they are unable to know God or the Absolute Truth.\u00a0Shree Krishna has stated in this verse that only one among numerous humans knows Him in Truth. In the next verse, He moves on to describe the material and spiritual dimensions of His energies.\n", "next shlok": 4}
