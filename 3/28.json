    "translation": "\n\nBG 3.28:\r\n                            O mighty-armed Arjun, illumined persons distinguish the soul as distinct from gu\u1e47as and karmas. They perceive that it is only the gu\u1e47as (in the shape of the senses, mind, and others) that move among the gu\u1e47as (in the shape of the objects of perception), and thus they do not get entangled in them.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe previous verse mentioned that the ahank\u0101ra vim\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101tm\u0101 (those who are bewildered by the ego and misidentify themselves with the body) think themselves to be the doers. This verse talks about the tattva-vit, or the knowers of the Truth. Having thus abolished the ego, they are free from bodily identifications, and are able to discern their spiritual identity distinct from the corporeal body. Hence, they are not beguiled into thinking of themselves as the doers of their material actions, and instead they attribute every activity to the movements of the three gu\u1e47as. Such God-realized Saints say: jo karai so hari karai, hota kab\u012br kab\u012br [v17] \u201cGod is doing everything, but people are thinking that I am doing.\u201d\n",
