All the parts of the system naturally draw from and give back to the whole. The sun lends stability to the earth and provides heat and light necessary for life to exist. Earth creates food from its soil for our nourishment and also holds essential minerals in its womb for a civilized lifestyle. The air moves the life force in our body and enables transmission of sound energy. We humans too are an integral part of the entire system of God\u2019s creation. The air that we breathe, the Earth that we walk upon, the water that we drink, and the light that illumines our day, are all gifts of creation to us. While we partake of these gifts to sustain our lives, we also have our duties toward the integral system. Shree Krishna says that we are obligated to participate with the creative force of nature by performing our prescribed duties in the service of God. That is the yaj\u00f1a he expects from us.Consider the example of a hand. It is an integral part of the body. It receives its nourishment\u2014blood, oxygen, nutrients, etc.\u2014from the body, and in turn, it performs necessary functions for the body. If the hand looks on this service as burdensome, and decides to get severed from the body, it cannot sustain itself for even a few minutes. It is in the performance of its yaj\u00f1a toward the body that the self-interest of the hand is also fulfilled. Similarly, we individual souls are tiny parts of the Supreme Soul and we all have our role to play in the grand scheme of things. When we perform our yaj\u00f1a toward him, our self-interest is naturally satiated.Generally, the term yaj\u00f1a refers to fire sacrifice. In the Bhagavad Gita, yaj\u00f1a includes all the prescribed actions laid down in the scriptures, when they are done as an offering to the Supreme.\n", "next shlok": 11}
