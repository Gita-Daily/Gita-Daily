However, our material intellect has innumerable imperfections, and so we are not always able to comprehend the sublimity of his teachings or appreciate their benefits. If we could, what would be the difference between us tiny souls and the Supreme Divine Personality? Thus, faith becomes a necessary ingredient for accepting the divine teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Wherever our intellect is unable to comprehend, rather than finding fault with the teachings, we must submit our intellect, \u201cShree Krishna has said it. There must be veracity in it, which I cannot understand at present. Let me accept it for now and engage in spiritual s\u0101dhan\u0101. I will be able to comprehend it in future, when I progress in spirituality through s\u0101dhan\u0101.\u201d This attitude is called \u015bhraddh\u0101, or faith.Jagadguru Shankaracharaya defines \u015bhraddh\u0101 as:\u00a0guru ved\u0101nta v\u0101kye\u1e63hu d\u1e5bi\u1e0dho vi\u015bhv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhraddh\u0101 [v18]\u201c\u015ahraddh\u0101 is strong faith in the words of the Guru and the scriptures.\u201dChaitanya Mahaprabhu explained it similarly:\u00a0\u015bhraddh\u0101 \u015bhabde vi\u015bhw\u0101sa kahe sud\u1e5bi\u1e0dha ni\u015bhchaya\u00a0(Chaitanya Charit\u0101m\u1e5bit, Madhya Leela, 22.62)[v19] \u201cThe word \u015ahraddh\u0101 means strong faith in God and Guru, even though we may not comprehend their message at present.\u201dThe British poet, Alfred Tennyson said: \u201cBy faith alone, embrace believing, where we cannot prove.\u201d So, \u015bhraddh\u0101 means earnestly digesting the comprehensible portions of the Bhagavad Gita, and also accepting the abstruse portions, with the hope that they will become comprehensible in future.However, one of the persistent defects of the material intellect is pride. Due to pride, whatever the intellect cannot comprehend at present, it often rejects as incorrect. Though Shree Krishna\u2019s teachings are presented by the omniscient Lord for the welfare of the souls, people still find fault in them, such as, \u201cWhy is God asking everything to be offered to him? Is he greedy? Is he an egotist that he asks Arjun to worship him?\u201d Shree Krishna says that such people are achetasa\u1e25, or \u201cdevoid of discrimination,\u201d because they cannot distinguish between the pure and the impure, the righteous and the unrighteous, the Creator and the created, the Supreme Master and the servant. Such people \u201cbring about their own ruin,\u201d because they reject the path to eternal salvation and keep rotating in the cycle of life and death.\n", "next shlok": 33}
