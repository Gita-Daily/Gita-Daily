    "commentary": "\nAs administrators of various processes of the universe, the devat\u0101s provide us with rain, wind, crops, vegetation, minerals, fertile soil, etc. We human beings are indebted to them for all that we receive from them. The devat\u0101s perform their duty, and expect us to perform our duty in the proper consciousness too. Since these celestial gods are all servants of the Supreme Lord, they become pleased when someone performs a sacrifice for him, and in turn assist such a soul by creating favorable material conditions. Thus, it is said that when we strongly resolve to serve God, the universe begins to cooperate with us.However, if we begin looking upon the gifts of nature, not as means of serving the Lord but as objects of our own enjoyment, Shree Krishna calls it a thieving mentality. Often people ask the question, \u201cI lead a virtuous life; I do not harm anyone, nor do I steal anything. But I do not believe in worshipping God, nor do I believe in him. Am I doing anything wrong?\u201d This question is answered in the above verse. Such persons may not be doing anything wrong in the eyes of humans, but they are thieves in the eyes of God. Let us say, we walk into someone\u2019s house, and without recognizing the owner, we sit on the sofa, eat from the refrigerator, and use the restroom. We may claim that we are not doing anything wrong, but we will be considered thieves in the eyes of the law, because the house does not belong to us. Similarly, the world that we live in was made by God, and everything in it belongs to him. If we utilize his creation for our pleasure, without acknowledging his dominion over it, from the divine perspective we are certainly committing theft.The famous king in Indian history, Chandragupta, asked Chanakya Pundit, his Guru, \u201cAccording to the Vedic scriptures, what is the position of the king vis-\u00e0-vis his subjects?\u201d Chanakya Pundit replied, \u201cThe king is the servant of the subjects and nothing else. His God-given duty is to help the citizens of his kingdom progress in their journey toward God-realization.\u201d Whether one is a king, a businessperson, a farmer, or a worker, each person, as an integral member of God\u2019s world, is expected to do his or her duty as a service to the Supreme.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains the importance of acknowledging the devat\u0101s and serving them as a way to receive natural resources. It clarifies that when sacrifices are performed for the Supreme Lord, the devat\u0101s become pleased and create favorable conditions. However, perceiving nature's gifts as personal enjoyment is considered thieving. It addresses whether leading a virtuous life without belief in or worship of God is wrong, stating that God perceives such people as thieves. The analogy of sitting in someone's house without acknowledging the owner is used to illustrate this point. The commentary also explores the king-subject relationship, emphasizing the king's role in supporting their citizens' journey toward God-realization. Ultimately, every individual is expected to fulfill their duty as service to the Supreme, irrespective of their occupation.",

It distinguishes between selfless sacrifices for the Supreme Lord and selfish enjoyment of nature's gifts. Leading a virtuous life without belief in God is considered thieving in God's eyes. An analogy of sitting in someone's house without acknowledging the owner is used to emphasize this.
