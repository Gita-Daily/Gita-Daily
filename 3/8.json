Hence, the Vedas prescribe duties for humans, to help them discipline their mind and senses. In fact, laziness is described as one of the biggest pitfalls on the spiritual path:\u0101lasya hi manu\u1e63hy\u0101\u1e47\u0101\u1e41 \u015bhar\u012brastho mah\u0101n ripu\u1e25n\u0101styudyamasamo bandh\u016b\u1e25 k\u1e5bitv\u0101 ya\u1e41 n\u0101vas\u012bdati [v4]\u201cLaziness is the greatest enemy of humans, and is especially pernicious since it resides in their own body. Work is their most trustworthy friend, and is a guarantee against downfall.\u201d Even the basic bodily activities like eating, bathing, and maintaining proper health require work. These obligatory actions are called nitya karm. To neglect these basic maintenance activities is not a sign of progress, but an indication of slothfulness, leading to emaciation and weakness of both body and mind. On the other hand, a cared for and nourished body is a positive adjunct on the road to spirituality. Thus, the state of inertia does not lend itself either to material or spiritual achievement. For the progress of our own soul, we should embrace the duties that help elevate and purify our mind and intellect.\n", "next shlok": 9}
