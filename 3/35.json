In fact, it is preferable to die in the discharge of one\u2019s duty, than to follow the path of another, which is fraught with danger.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, the word dharma has been used four times. Dharma is a word commonly used in Hinduism and Buddhism. But it is the most elusive word to translate into the English language. Terms like righteousness, good conduct, duty, noble quality, etc. only describe an aspect of its meaning. Dharma comes from the root word dh\u1e5bi, which means \u1e0dh\u0101ra\u1e47 karane yogya, or \u201cresponsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions that are appropriate for us.\u201d For example, the dharma of the soul is to love God. It is like the central law of our being.\n The prefix swa means \u201cthe self.\u201d Thus, swa-dharma is our personal dharma, which is the dharma applicable to our context, situation, maturity, and profession in life. This swa-dharma can change as our context in life changes, and as we grow spiritually. By asking Arjun to follow his swa-dharma, Shree Krishna is telling him to follow his profession, and not change it because someone else may be doing something else.\n It is more enjoyable to be ourselves than to pretend to be someone else. The duties born of our nature can be easily performed with stability of mind. The duties of others may seem attractive from a distance and we may think of switching, but that is a risky thing to do. If they conflict with our nature, they will create disharmony in our senses, mind, and intellect. This will be detrimental for our consciousness and will hinder our progress on the spiritual path. Shree Krishna emphasizes this point dramatically by saying that it is better to die in the faithful performance of one\u2019s duty than to be in the unnatural position of doing another\u2019s duty.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary explores the concept of dharma, a complex term in Hinduism and Buddhism. Dharma refers to our responsibilities, duties, thoughts, and actions appropriate for us. It is our personal dharma, called swa-dharma, that is applicable to our context, situation, maturity, and profession in life. Shree Krishna advises Arjun to follow his swa-dharma, emphasizing the importance of staying true to oneself. Duties based on our nature are performed more easily and bring stability of mind. Switching to another's duties can create disharmony and hinder spiritual progress. Shree Krishna highlights the value of faithful duty performance and warns against the unnatural position of doing another's duty."
