    "translation": "\n\nBG 3.29:\r\n                            Those who are deluded by the operation of the gu\u1e47as become attached to the results of their actions. But the wise who understand these truths should not unsettle such ignorant people who know very little.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe question may be raised that if soul is distinct from the gu\u1e47as and their activities, then why are the ignorant attached to sense objects? Shree Krishna explains in this verse that they become bewildered by the gu\u1e47as of the material energy, and think themselves to be the doers. Infatuated by the three modes of material nature, they work for the express purpose of being able to enjoy sensual and mental delights. They are unable to perform actions as a matter of duty, without desiring rewards.\nHowever, the k\u1e5bitsna-vit (persons with knowledge) should not disturb the minds of the ak\u1e5bitsna-vit (persons without knowledge). This means that the wise should not force their thoughts onto ignorant persons by saying, \u201cYou are the soul, not the body, and hence karm is meaningless; give it up.\u201d Rather, they should instruct the ignorant to perform their respective karm, and slowly help them rise above attachment. In this way, after presenting the distinctions between those who are spiritually wise and those who are ignorant, Shree Krishna gives the sober caution not to unsettle the minds of the ignorant.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that the ignorant become attached to sense objects due to their bewilderment caused by the material energy. They mistake themselves as the doers and work to indulge in sensual and mental pleasures. They are unable to perform actions without desiring rewards. However, the wise should not disturb the minds of the ignorant and force their thoughts onto them. Instead, they should guide them to perform their respective duties and gradually help them rise above attachment. Shree Krishna cautions against unsettling the minds of the ignorant and highlights the differences between the spiritually wise and the ignorant.",
