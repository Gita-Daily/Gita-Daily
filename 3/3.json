    "commentary": "\nIn verse 2.39, Shree Krishna explained the two paths leading to spiritual perfection. The first is the acquisition of knowledge through the analytical study of the nature of the soul and its distinction from the body. Shree Krishna refers to this as s\u0101nkhya yog. People with a philosophic bend of mind are inclined toward this path of knowing the self through intellectual analysis. The second is the process of working in the spirit of devotion to God, or karm yog. Shree Krishna also calls this buddhi yog\u00b8 as explained in the previous verse. Working in this manner purifies the mind, and knowledge naturally awakens in the purified mind, thus leading to enlightenment.Amongst people interested in the spiritual path, there are those who are inclined toward contemplation and then there are those inclined to action. Hence, both these paths have existed ever since the soul\u2019s aspiration for God-realization has existed. Shree Krishna touches upon both of them since his message is meant for people of all temperaments and inclinations.\n",

The first is the path of acquiring knowledge through analytical study of the soul and its distinction from the body, known as s\u0101nkhya yog. This path is suitable for those inclined towards intellectual analysis. The second path is working in devotion to God, known as karm yog or buddhi yog. By working in this manner, the mind is purified and knowledge naturally emerges, leading to enlightenment. Shree Krishna acknowledges that people have different inclinations towards contemplation or action, and his message is meant for individuals of all temperaments and inclinations who have the aspiration for God-realization.",
