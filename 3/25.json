    "commentary": "\nPreviously, in verse 3.20, Shree Krishna had used the expression loka-sa\u1e45graham ev\u0101pi sampa\u015bhyan meaning, \u201cwith a view to the welfare of the masses.\u201d In this verse, the expression loka-sa\u1e45graham chik\u012br\u1e63hu\u1e25 means \u201cwishing the welfare of the world.\u201d Thus, Shree Krishna again emphasizes that the wise should always act for the benefit of humankind.\nAlso, in this verse the expression sakt\u0101\u1e25 avidv\u0101nsa\u1e25 has been used for people who are as yet in bodily consciousness, and hence attached to worldly pleasures, but who have full faith in the Vedic rituals sanctioned by the scriptures. They are called ignorant because though they have bookish knowledge of the scriptures, they do not comprehend the final goal of God-realization. Such ignorant people perform their duty scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, without indolence or doubt. They have firm faith that the performance of Vedic duties and rituals will bring the material rewards they desire. If the faith of such people in rituals is broken, without their having developed faith in the higher principle of devotion, they will have nowhere to go. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam states:\nt\u0101vat karm\u0101\u1e47i kurv\u012bta na nirvidyeta y\u0101vat\u0101\nmat-kath\u0101-\u015bhrava\u1e47\u0101dau v\u0101 \u015bhraddh\u0101 y\u0101van na j\u0101yate (11.20.9)[v16]\n\u201cOne should continue to perform karm as long as one has not developed renunciation from the sense objects and attachment to God.\u201d  \nShree Krishna urges Arjun that just as ignorant people faithfully perform ritualistic duties, so also the wise should perform their works dutifully, not for material rewards, but for setting an ideal for the rest of society. Besides, the particular situation in which Arjun finds himself is a dharma yuddha (war of righteousness). Thus, for the welfare of society, Arjun should perform his duty as a warrior.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna emphasizes acting for the welfare of the world and the importance of performing duties faithfully. The verse highlights the distinction between those still attached to worldly pleasures but following Vedic rituals and those who have realized the goal of God-realization. The ignorant ones faithfully follow the scriptures in hopes of material rewards, while the wise should perform their duties as an example for society. Arjuna is urged to fulfill his duties as a warrior in the dharma yuddha, emphasizing the importance of societal welfare. It is stated that one should continue performing actions until renunciation and attachment to God are developed.",
