The knife in itself is neither murderous nor benedictory\u2014its effect is determined by how it is used. As Shakespeare said: \u201cFor there is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\u201d Similarly, work in itself is neither good nor bad. Depending upon the state of the mind, it can be either binding or elevating. Work done for the enjoyment of one\u2019s senses and the gratification of one\u2019s pride is the cause of bondage in the material world, while work performed as yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice) for the pleasure of the Supreme Lord liberates one from the bonds of Maya and attracts divine grace. Since it is our nature to perform actions, we are forced to work in one of the two modes. We cannot remain without working for even a moment as our mind cannot remain still.If we do not perform actions as a sacrifice to God, we will be forced to work to gratify our mind and senses. Instead, when we perform work as a sacrifice, we then look upon the whole world and everything in it as belonging to God, and therefore, meant for utilization in his service. A beautiful ideal for this was established by King Raghu, the ancestor of Lord Ram. Raghu performed the Vi\u015bhwajit sacrifice, which requires donating all of one\u2019s possessions in charity.sa vi\u015bhwajitam \u0101jahre yaj\u00f1a\u1e41 sarvasva dak\u1e63hi\u1e47am\u0101d\u0101na\u1e41 hi visarg\u0101ya sat\u0101\u1e41 v\u0101rimuch\u0101m iva (Raghuvan\u015bh 4.86)[v5]\u201cRaghu performed the Vi\u015bhwajit yaj\u00f1a with the thought that just as clouds gather water from the Earth, not for their enjoyment, but to shower it back upon the Earth, similarly, all he possessed as a king had been gathered from the public in taxes, not for his pleasure, but for the pleasure of God. So he decided to use his wealth to please God by serving his citizens with it.\u201d After the yaj\u00f1a, Raghu donated all his possessions to his citizens. Then, donning the rags of a beggar and holding an earthen pot, he went out to beg for his meal.While resting under a tree, he heard a group of people discussing, \u201cOur king is so benevolent. He has given away everything in charity.\u201d Raghu was pained on hearing his praise and spoke out, \u201cWhat are you discussing?\u201d They answered, \u201cWe are praising our king. There is nobody in the world as charitable as him.\u201d Raghu retorted, \u201cDo not ever say that again. Raghu has given nothing.\u201d They said, \u201cWhat kind of person are you who are criticizing our king? Everyone knows that Raghu has donated everything he owned.\u201d Raghu replied, \u201cGo and ask your king that when he came into this world did he possess anything? He was born empty-handed, is it not? Then what was his that he has given away?\u201dThis is the spirit of karm yog, in which we see the whole world as belonging to God, and hence meant for the satisfaction of God. We then perform our duties not for gratifying our mind and senses, but for the pleasure of God. Lord Vishnu instructed the Prachetas in this fashion:g\u1e5bihe\u1e63hv \u0101vi\u015bhat\u0101\u1e41 ch\u0101pi pu\u1e41s\u0101\u1e41 ku\u015bhala-karma\u1e47\u0101mmad-v\u0101rt\u0101-y\u0101ta-y\u0101m\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 na bandh\u0101ya g\u1e5bih\u0101 mat\u0101\u1e25 (Bh\u0101gavatam 4.30.19)[v6]\u201cThe perfect karm yogis, even while fulfilling their household duties, perform all their works as yaj\u00f1a to me, knowing me to be the Enjoyer of all activities. They spend whatever free time they have in hearing and chanting my glories. Such people, though living in the world, never get bound by their actions.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 10}
