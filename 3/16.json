    "commentary": "\nChakra, or cycle, means an ordered series of events. The cycle from grains to rains has been described in verse 3.14. All members of this universal wheel of action perform their duties and contribute to its smooth rotation. Since we also partake of the fruits of this natural cycle, we too must do our bounden duty in the chain.We humans are the only ones in this chain who have been bestowed with the ability to choose our actions by our own free will. We can thus either contribute to the harmony of the cycle or bring about discord in the smooth running of this cosmic mechanism. When the majority of the people of human society accept their responsibility to live as integral parts of the universal system, material prosperity abounds and spiritual growth is engendered. Such periods become golden eras in the social and cultural history of humankind. Conversely, when a major section of humankind begins to violate the universal system and rejects its responsibility as an integral part of the cosmic system, then material nature begins to punish, and peace and prosperity become scarce.The wheel of nature has been set up by God for disciplining, training, and elevating all living beings of varying levels of consciousness. Shree Krishna explains to Arjun that those who do not perform the yaj\u00f1a enjoined of them become slaves of their senses and lead a sinful existence. Thus, they live in vain. But persons conforming to the divine law become pure at heart and free from material contamination.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains the concept of Chakra, a cycle, in the Bhagavad Gita. It states that all beings in the universal wheel of action contribute to its smooth rotation, including humans who have the ability to choose their actions. When humans accept their responsibility and live in harmony with the universal system, prosperity and spiritual growth abound. However, when a major section of humanity rejects their responsibility, nature punishes and peace becomes scarce. The wheel of nature is set up by God to discipline and elevate all living beings. Those who do not perform their duties become slaves to their senses, while those who conform to divine laws become pure at heart and free from material contamination."
