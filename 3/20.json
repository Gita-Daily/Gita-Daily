    "translation": "Janaka and others attained perfection verily by action only; even with a view to the protection of the masses thou shouldst perform action.Whatsoever a great man does, that the other men also do; whatever he sets up as the standard, that the world (mankind) follows.",
    "commentary": "\nKing Janak attained perfection through karm yog, while discharging his kingly duties. Even after reaching the transcendental platform, he continued to do his worldly duties, purely for the reason that it would set a good example for the world to follow. Many other Saints did the same.Humanity is inspired by the ideals that they see in the lives of great people. Such leaders inspire society by their example and become shining beacons for the masses to follow. Leaders of society thus have a moral responsibility to set lofty examples for inspiring the rest of the population by their words, deeds, and character. When noble leaders are in the forefront, the rest of society naturally gets uplifted in morality, selflessness, and spiritual strength. But in times when there is a vacuum of principled leadership, the rest of society has no standards to pursue and slumps into self-centeredness, moral bankruptcy, and spiritual lassitude. Hence, great personalities should always act in an exemplary manner to set the standard for the world. Even though they themselves may have risen to the transcendental platform, and may not need to perform prescribed Vedic duties, by doing so, they inspire others to perform prescribed Vedic actions.If a great leader of society becomes a karm sany\u0101s\u012b, and renounces work, it sets an errant precedent for others. The leader may be at the transcendental platform and therefore eligible to renounce work and engage completely in spirituality. However, others in society use their example as an excuse for escapism, to run away from their responsibilities. Such escapists cite the instances of the great karm sany\u0101s\u012bs, such as Shankaracharya, Madhvacharya, Nimbarkacharya, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu. Following their lofty footsteps, these imposters also renounce worldly duties and take sany\u0101s, even though they have not yet attained the purity of mind required for it. In India, we find thousands of such sadhus. They copy the examples of the great sany\u0101s\u012bs and don the ochre robes, without the concurrent internal enlightenment and bliss. Though externally renounced, their nature forces them to seek happiness, and devoid of the divine bliss of God, they begin indulging in the lowly pleasure of intoxication. Thus, they slip even below the level of people in household life, as stated in the following verse:brahma j\u00f1\u0101na j\u0101nyo nah\u012b\u1e45, karm diye chhi\u1e6dak\u0101ya,tulas\u012b ais\u012b \u0101tm\u0101 sahaja naraka mah\u00f1 j\u0101ya. [v15]Sage Tulsidas says: \u201cOne who renounces worldly duties, without the concurrent internal enlightenment with divine knowledge, treads the quick path to hell.\u201dInstead, if a great leader is a karm yogi, at least the followers will continue to do their karm and dutifully perform their responsibilities. This will help them learn to discipline their mind and senses, and slowly rise to the transcendental platform. Hence, to present an example for society to follow, Shree Krishna suggests that Arjun should practice karm yog. He now gives his own example to illustrate the above point.\n",

Leaders have a moral responsibility to inspire society through their words, deeds, and character. If leaders renounce work, it sets a wrong precedent for others to escape from responsibilities. Many imposters mimic great renunciants without attaining the required purity of mind, leading to moral bankruptcy. It is better for leaders to be karma yogis, as it encourages followers to dutifully perform their responsibilities and discipline their mind and senses. Krishna advises Arjuna to practice karma yoga to set an example for society, drawing upon his own example.",
    "newest_commentary": "The commentary highlights the importance of leaders and saints performing their worldly duties while being spiritually advanced. Renouncing work can lead to others avoiding their responsibilities. It warns against imposters who pretend to be renunciants without the required purity of mind. Leaders should follow the path of karma yoga, inspiring their followers to dutifully fulfill their responsibilities and discipline their mind and senses. Krishna advises Arjuna to practice karma yoga as an example for society, drawing upon his own experience."
