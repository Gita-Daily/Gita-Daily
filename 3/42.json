    "translation": "They say that the senses are superior (to the body); superior to the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect; one who is superior even to the intellect is He (the Self).",
    "commentary": "\nAn inferior entity can be controlled by its superior entity. Shree Krishna explains the gradation of superiority amongst the instruments God has provided to us. He describes that the body is made of gross matter; superior to it are the five knowledge-bearing senses (which grasp the perceptions of taste, touch, sight, smell, and sound); beyond the senses is the mind; superior to the mind is the intellect, with its ability to discriminate; but even beyond the intellect is the divine soul.\nThis knowledge of the sequence of superiority amongst the senses, mind, intellect, and soul, can now be used for rooting out lust, as explained in the final verse of this chapter.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "In the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna elucidates the hierarchy of superiority among the instruments bestowed upon us by God. The body, composed of gross matter, is surpassed by the five knowledge-bearing senses, which perceive taste, touch, sight, smell, and sound. Beyond the senses lies the mind, followed by the discriminating intellect. However, even the intellect is subordinate to the divine soul. This understanding of the progression from senses to mind, intellect, and soul can aid in removing lust, as mentioned in the concluding verse of this chapter."
