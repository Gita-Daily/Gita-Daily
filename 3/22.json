Since, we have not attained perfect bliss as yet, we feel dissatisfied and incomplete. So whatever we do is for the sake of attaining bliss. However, bliss is one of God\u2019s energies and he alone possesses it to the infinite extent. He is perfect and complete in himself and has no need of anything outside of himself. Thus, he is also called \u0100tm\u0101r\u0101m (one who rejoices in the self), \u0100tma-rat\u012b (one who is attracted to his or her own self), and \u0100tma-kr\u012b\u1e0da (one who performs divine pastimes with his or her own self).If such a personality does work, there can be only one reason for it\u2014it will not be for oneself, rather for the welfare of others. Thus, Shree Krishna tells Arjun that although in his personal form as Shree Krishna, he has no duty to perform in the universe, yet he works for the welfare of others. He next explains the welfare that is accomplished when he works.\n",
