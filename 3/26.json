    "commentary": "\nGreat persons have greater responsibility because common people follow them. So Shree Krishna urges that wise people should not perform any actions or make any utterances that lead the ignorant toward downfall. It may be argued that if the wise feel compassion for the ignorant, they should give them the highest knowledge\u2014the knowledge of God-realization. Lord Krishna neutralizes this argument by stating na buddhi-bheda\u1e41 janayet, meaning the ignorant should not be asked to abandon duties by giving superior instructions they are not qualified to understand.\nUsually, people in material consciousness consider only two options. Either they are willing to work hard for fruitive results or they wish to give up all exertions on the plea that all works are laborious, painful, and wrought with evil. Between these, working for results is far superior to the escapist approach. Hence, the spiritually wise in Vedic knowledge should inspire the ignorant to perform their duties with attentiveness and care. If the minds of the ignorant become disturbed and unsettled then they may lose faith in working altogether, and with actions stopped and knowledge not arising, the ignorant will lose out from both sides.\nIf both the ignorant and the wise perform Vedic actions, then what is the difference between them? Apprehending such a question, Shree Krishna explains this in the next two verses.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna emphasizes the responsibility of wise individuals to guide the ignorant towards the right path. He advises against leading them astray and instead encourages sharing the knowledge of God-realization. However, it is important not to overwhelm the ignorant with teachings beyond their comprehension. Lord Krishna states that it is better for the spiritually wise to inspire the ignorant to perform their duties diligently rather than abandoning them altogether. If the ignorant become unsettled, they may lose faith in their actions and knowledge, resulting in a loss for both parties. Shree Krishna addresses the question of the difference between the actions performed by the ignorant and the wise in the following verses.",
