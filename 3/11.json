    "commentary": "\nThe celestial gods, or devat\u0101s, are in-charge of the administration of the universe. The Supreme Lord does his work of managing the universe through them. These devat\u0101s live within this material universe, in the higher planes of existence, called swarg, or the celestial abodes. The devat\u0101s are not God; they are souls like us. They occupy specific posts in the affairs of running the world. Consider the Federal government of a country. There is a Secretary of State, a Secretary of the Treasury, a Secretary of Defense, Attorney General, and so on. These are posts, and chosen people occupy those posts for a limited tenure. At the end of the tenure, the government changes and all the post-holders change too. Similarly, in administering the affairs of the world, there are posts such as Agni Dev (the god of fire), V\u0101yu Dev (the god of the wind), Varu\u1e47a Dev (the god of the ocean), Indra Dev (the king of the celestial gods), etc. Souls selected by virtue of their deeds in past lives occupy these seats for a fixed number of ages, and administer the affairs of the universe. These are the devat\u0101s (celestial gods).The Vedas mention various ceremonies and processes for the satisfaction of the celestial gods, and in turn these devat\u0101s bestow material prosperity. However, when we perform our yaj\u00f1a for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord, the celestial gods are automatically appeased, just as when we water the root of a tree, the water inevitably reaches its flowers, fruits, leaves, branches, and twigs. The Skandh Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:archite deva deve\u015bhe \u015bha\u1e45kha chakra gad\u0101dharearchit\u0101\u1e25 sarve dev\u0101\u1e25 syur yata\u1e25 sarva gato hari\u1e25\u00a0[v7]\u201cBy worshipping the Supreme Lord Shree Vishnu, we automatically worship all the celestial gods, since they all derive their power from him.\u201d Thus, the performance of yaj\u00f1a is naturally pleasing to the devat\u0101s, who then create prosperity for living beings by favorably adjusting the elements of material nature.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the celestial gods, known as devat\u0101s, are responsible for managing the universe under the guidance of the Supreme Lord. These devat\u0101s reside in the celestial abodes and hold specific positions in the administration of the world. Just like government officials, they occupy these positions for a limited time based on their past deeds. The Vedas prescribe rituals to satisfy the devat\u0101s, who in turn bestow material prosperity. However, when we perform yaj\u00f1a (sacrificial offerings) for the Supreme Lord's satisfaction, the devat\u0101s are automatically appeased. It is like watering the root of a tree, which nourishes the entire tree. By worshipping Lord Vishnu, all the devat\u0101s are worshipped as they derive their power from Him. Therefore, performing yaj\u00f1a naturally pleases the devat\u0101s, leading them to create prosperity by harmonizing the elements of material nature.",
