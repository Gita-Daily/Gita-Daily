We regard ourselves as the physical body and get attracted to our bodily relations; parents, spouse, children, material wealth, etc. We feel they are the most significant. We also forget that it is God who is the creator and sustainer of the entire universe.In this verse, Lord Shree Krishna has said that the entire creation; is the manifestation of his energy. Even the Sun gets its radiance from him. According to scientific theories, the energy emitted\u00a0every second by the sun is equivalent to millions of nuclear power plants put together, and it\u00a0has been an uninterrupted process for billions of years. Yet this energy has not reduced in any way. The glory and brilliance of the sun are\u00a0a part of God\u2019s wonderful creation.Similarly, the night sky is lit\u00a0up by the moon. Though our mundane intellect might want us to believe and it is also scientifically concluded that moonshine is due to the reflection of the sun\u2019s light. But the periodic movement of the moon is also part of God\u2019s amazing creation. The sun, the moon, the planets, stars, the panch mahabhootas (earth, water, air, fire, and ether); in fact, the entire universe is a manifestation of God\u2019s vibh\u016btis (opulence). It would be very na\u00efve to think that such an amazing celestial arrangement is a result of some random big bang.There is a story in Kenopanishad, which explicates this. Once there was a prolonged war between the devat\u0101s (celestial gods) and the daityas (demons from the nether regions). Eventually, the devat\u0101s won by the grace of God. But their pride made them think that it was due to their own strength. God wanted to teach them a lesson; He manifested as an effulgent and powerful yak\u1e63ha (a semi-celestial being) in the celestial sky.When Indra, the King of Heaven saw this yak\u1e63ha, he felt insecure and intimidated. To find out who this yak\u1e63ha\u00a0was, he sent Agni, the fire god. With great pride,\u00a0Agni challenged the yak\u1e63ha and said, \u201cI am the fire god, and possess the power to burn the entire world within seconds, please reveal yourself.\u201d The yak\u1e63ha put in front of him a piece of straw and asked if he could burn it. Agni laughed, \u201cCan a blade of grass be a test for my immense power? Let that be.\u201d But when he moved forward to burn it, he could not and started feeling very cold himself. God had taken away his power, defeated and embarrassed he ran back to Indra.Next, Indra sent Vayu, the wind god to inquire who this yak\u1e63ha was. He went to the yak\u1e63ha and said, \u201cI am the wind god and possess the power to turn the world upside down within a few seconds, reveal who you are?\u201d Again, the yak\u1e63ha put a piece of straw in front of Vayu and said, \u201cTurn this over if you can?\u201d Vayu smirked with pride and tried to blow it, but could not. He felt powerless, and with great effort, he returned to Indra exhausted.Now Indra was raged and came to challenge the\u00a0yak\u1e63ha\u00a0himself. But by then the\u00a0yak\u1e63ha\u00a0had disappeared and in his place was seated Goddess Uma, God\u2019s divine\u00a0Yogmaya\u00a0power. A baffled Indra asked her, \u201cO Divine Mother, please tell me who was that powerful\u00a0yak\u1e63ha?\u201d She answered, \u201cO imprudent child, you could not recognize Him? Your pride had blinded your prudence. He was your Supreme Father, your creator, and power source, without him you would be powerless.\u201d Realizing his mistake, Indra begged for forgiveness.\u00a0\n", "next shlok": 13}
