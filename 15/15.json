    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Lord Shree Krishna says that He has bestowed upon us this amazing ability of memory and knowledge. While the mind and the intellect are like software; the brain can be considered hardware. Yet this mechanism of the brain is way beyond human understanding.Although there is\u00a0vast development in technology, there are many areas where the scientific community is still struggling. For example, surgeons who perform brain transplant get delighted with their feat; but do not fully understand its functions. Another example is of face-recognition technology. It is remarkable\u00a0that humans can very easily recognize someone they meet after several years, even though there are many changes in their looks. Whereas,\u00a0present-day computers sometimes cannot even recognize\u00a0unchanged faces. How amazing it is that while the scanner software finds it difficult to read even typewritten text; humans can read even sketchy handwritings, without much effort. Such are the mysteries of the human brain which the Supreme Lord has created.\u00a0Shree Krishna says that He has also given us this power of forgetting the past. Similar to how unwanted records are deleted from a computer, living beings wipe off unwanted memories. Else there would be an information overload.\u00a0Uddhav says to Shree Krishna:\u00a0\u00a0tvatto j\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 hi j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101\u1e41 pramo\u1e63has te \u2019tra \u015bhaktita\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0(Bhagavatam 11.22.28)\u201cFrom You alone, the knowledge of the living being arises, and by Your potency that knowledge is stolen away.\u201d\u00a0Other than the internal knowledge that we carry, there is another source of knowledge; that is from the scriptures. In this verse, the Lord has further revealed his glories in regards to the manifestation of the Vedas; that he is the creator, knower, and writer of the Vedas. God is divine and all his creations, including the Vedas, are divine. He alone is the knower of their true meaning; and only by his grace can a fortunate soul know the Vedas.\u00a0Ved Vyas\u00a0the author of the Ved\u0101nt Dar\u015bhan is considered to be an avatar of God. And Shree Krishna has specifically mentioned that he is the author of the Ved\u0101nt.\u00a0Eventually, He says\u00a0that although the Vedas give out numerous instructions both material and spiritual, the final objective of all knowledge is to know Him. The purpose of the rituals and ceremonies instructed are to lure people back from the material world towards spirituality. They act as an intermediate step to detach them from their materialistic mindset and direct them towards God.\u00a0The\u00a0Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had\u00a0(1.2.15) states:\u00a0sarve ved\u0101 yat padam\u0101mananti\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAll the Vedic mantras are actually pointing towards God.\u201d Memorizing and reciting the Vedic mantras in proper meter, following all the rituals, meditating or even awakening the\u00a0ku\u1e47\u1e0dalin\u012b\u00a0power; all will be worthless if we do not know God. Only those who have learned to truly love God, have understood the real teachings of all the Vedic scriptures.\u00a0Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj states:\u00a0sarva \u015bh\u0101stra s\u0101ra yaha govind r\u0101dhe, \u0101\u1e6dho\u1e45 y\u0101m mana hari guru me\u1e45 lag\u0101 de\u00a0\u00a0(R\u0101dh\u0101 Govind Geet)\u00a0\u201cThe essence of all the scriptures is to engage your mind day and night in loving devotion to God and Guru.\u201d\u00a0In the next two verses, Shree Krishna has described the terms\u00a0k\u1e63har, ak\u1e63har, and Puru\u1e63hottam\u00a0and given proper perspective to the knowledge revealed so far.\n",

The brain's mechanism surpasses human understanding, as seen in the limitations of technology in areas like face recognition.
