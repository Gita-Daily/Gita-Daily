    "commentary": "\nLord Shree Krishna speaks of the eternal A\u015bhvatth tree, which is an upside-down peepal (sacred fig) tree with its roots above and branches below. A\u015bhvatth also means; which will not remain the same even on the next day or something which is constantly changing. The Sanskrit word for the world, Sansar is defined in the Sanskrit dictionary as sansarat\u012bti sans\u0101ra\u1e25; something that is constantly shifting.\u00a0 Another Sanskrit word for the world Jagat is also defined as gachchhat\u012bti jagat, that means it is a constantly moving world. The world is not just moving or constantly changing, but someday it will be completely destroyed and reverted unto God. Therefore, the world we live in is temporary, or A\u015bhvatth.The Lord explains that this material world is like a huge A\u015bhvatth tree for the soul. Its roots are going upwards (\u016brdhva-m\u016blam) originating from God; nourished and supported by Him. The trunk and branches which are extending downwards (adha\u1e25-\u015bh\u0101kham) encompass all the life-forms from different abodes of the material realm. Its leaves are the Vedic mantras (chhand\u0101nsi), which describe rituals, ceremonies, and its reward. By performing such rituals, the soul can ascend to the heavenly abodes and enjoy celestial pleasures, but eventually, when the rewards deplete, they have to fall back to earth.In this way, the leaves of the A\u015bhvatth tree nourish the material existence of the souls and perpetuate the continuous cycle of life and death. Due to this continuity, the beginning and the end are not experienced by the souls. Hence, this tree form of the world is Avyayam or eternal. As the water from the oceans evaporates forming clouds that rain the earth, which then forms rivers, and eventually flows back to the oceans. Likewise, the cycle of life and death is also continuous.The Vedas also mention this tree:\u016brdhvam\u016blo \u2019v\u0101k\u015bh\u0101kha e\u1e63ho \u2019\u015bhvattha\u1e25 san\u0101tana\u1e25 \u00a0 (Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had 2.3.1)\u00a0\u201cThe a\u015bhvatth tree, with its roots upward and branches downward is eternal.\u201d\u016brdhvam\u016bla\u1e41 arv\u0101k\u015bh\u0101kha\u1e41 v\u1e5bik\u1e63ha\u1e41 yo sampratina sa j\u0101tu jana\u1e25 \u015bhraddhay\u0101tm\u1e5bityutyurm\u0101 m\u0101rayaditi \u00a0 (Taittir\u012bya \u0100ra\u1e47yak 1.11.5)\u201cThose who know this tree with its roots upward and branches downward will not believe that death can finish them.\u201d\u00a0The intention of describing this tree in the Vedas was to make us understand that, we are beyond the cycle of life and death, and we should work towards cutting this tree down. For the same purpose, Lord Shree Krishna has mentioned that one who understands the secret (of cutting) this tree of samsara is the knower of the Vedas (veda vit).\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary speaks about the concept of the A\u015bhvatth tree, a metaphor for the temporary and ever-changing material world. The world is described as constantly shifting and moving, ultimately leading to its destruction and return to God. The material world serves as a support system for the soul, with its roots originating from God and its branches encompassing all life forms. The Vedic mantras are compared to the leaves of the tree, sustaining the cycle of life and death. This continuous cycle prevents the souls from experiencing the beginning and end. The analogy of water evaporating, forming clouds, raining, and eventually flowing back to the ocean is used to illustrate the eternal nature of the cycle. The Vedas mention this tree to emphasize that we should strive to transcend the cycle of life and death. Understanding the secret of cutting this tree signifies knowledge of the Vedas.",
