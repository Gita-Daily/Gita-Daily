This revelation by God suggests that such an approach is na\u00efve. It is God\u2019s energy which fires up the digestive process in living beings.Chaturvidham means four types and annam means food. Food is categorized into four types: 1. Bhojya - Foods that are chewed, such as bread, chapatti, etc.\u00a0 2. Peya - These are mostly liquid or semi-solid foods which we have to swallow or drink, such as milk, juice, etc.\u00a0 3. Ko\u015bhya - Foods that are sucked, such as sugarcane.\u00a0 4. Lehya - This includes foods that are licked, such as honey, etc.In the last few verses, Shri Krishna has explicated how God supports every aspect of our life. With his energy, He makes the earth habitable, nourishes all vegetation, and even ignites the gastric fire to digest our food. In the next verse, he concludes by stating that He is the master of all knowledge.\n", "next shlok": 15}
