In this verse, He has called Himself\u00a0Puru\u1e63hottam, the Divine Supreme Person who transcends over the material world, which includes both\u00a0k\u1e63har the\u00a0perishable and\u00a0ak\u1e63har\u00a0the imperishable divine souls.\u00a0 \u00a0Does that mean the\u00a0Puru\u1e63hottam\u00a0He has referred to and Lord Shree Krishna Himself are two different entities? To eliminate any such doubts, in this verse, while referring to Himself Shree Krishna has used the term\u00a0aham\u00a0(I), which is first person singular. He also said that the Vedas and the Smritis have described Him similarly:k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a eva paro devas ta\u1e41 dhy\u0101yet ta\u1e41 rasayet ta\u1e41 yajet ta\u1e41 bhajed(Gop\u0101l T\u0101pani Upani\u1e63had)\u201cLord Krishna is the Supreme Lord.
