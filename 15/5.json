    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna has explained the requisites for complete surrender to the Supreme Lord, who is at the base of this enigmatic a\u015bhvatth tree. \u00a0The first step is to give up all pride, which is due to ignorance. The embodied souls have an illusion that they are the governors of all the material wealth that they have acquired, and continue accumulating more. Their minds are blinded by pride borne by ignorance, they think that all this is for their enjoyment, and would continue giving them happiness. A soul in such a state does not comprehend God as the owner of all. Thus, cannot surrender unto his will.Only through proper knowledge of God can this false notion of being the enjoyer be removed. It is necessary to realize that God alone is the owner of all the material energy and it needs to be used for his service only. He is the master of the entire creation, and the souls are his eternal servants. The souls should give up the attitude of pride and develop an attitude of selfless service to the Lord. This can be achieved by understanding the true nature of the self as the eternal servant, eliminating material attachments that pull us towards the world and away from him. The Padma Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:d\u0101sa bh\u016btamida\u1e41 tasya jagatsth\u0101vara jangamam\u015bhr\u012bmann\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a sw\u0101m\u012b jagat\u0101nprabhur\u012b\u015bhwara\u1e25\u201cThe Supreme Lord Narayan is the controller and the Lord of the world.\u00a0 All moving and non-moving beings and entities in this creation are His servants.\u201d\u00a0 Hence, as our desire to serve God increases, the illusion of being the enjoyer of prak\u1e5biti (material world) gets gradually eliminated and the heart is cleansed.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj emphasizes this above everything else, as the most powerful means for purifying the heart:sau b\u0101tana k\u012b b\u0101ta ika, dharu mural\u012bdhara dhy\u0101na,ba\u1e5bhavahu sev\u0101-v\u0101san\u0101, yaha sau j\u00f1\u0101nana j\u00f1\u0101na.(Bhakti \u015ahatak, verse 74)\u00a0\u201cOut of a hundred advice for purification, the most important is this.\u00a0 Let your mind be absorbed in the divine flute-player, Shree Krishna, and keep increasing your desire to serve Him.\u00a0 This counsel is more important than a hundred such gems of knowledge.\u201d\u00a0But what happens once our etheric hearts are cleansed and become perfectly situated in the loving service of the Lord? In this verse, Shree Krishna says that all those perfected souls enter his spiritual realm and stay there forever. Once the state of God-realization is achieved, the material realm serves no purpose, the soul is free from the cycle of life and death. It now stays in God\u2019s divine Abode along with other perfected, God-realized souls. The material realm is only one-fourth, while the spiritual realm is three-fourths of the entire creation. As a city prison only occupies a small part of a large city, similarly, the material realm is a very small part of God\u2019s vast creation. The Vedas state:p\u0101do \u2019sya vi\u015bhw\u0101 bh\u016bt\u0101ni, trip\u0101dasya am\u1e5bitam divi\u00a0\u00a0 (Puru\u1e63h S\u016bktam Mantra 3)\u201cThis temporary world made from the material energy is but one part of creation.\u00a0 The other three parts are the eternal Abode of God that is beyond the phenomenon of life and death.\u201dIn the next verse, Shree Krishna explains the nature of the eternal Abode.\n",

The first step is giving up pride, which arises from ignorance. Souls often believe they are the owners of material wealth and accumulate more. To surrender to God, one must understand that He is the true owner and the souls are His eternal servants. This understanding leads to selfless service. The desire to serve God removes the illusion of being the enjoyer of the material world. As the heart is purified, souls enter God's spiritual realm, free from the cycle of life and death. The material realm is only a small part of God's vast creation, while the spiritual realm is the majority. The Vedas state that the material world is temporary, whereas God's eternal Abode is beyond life and death.",
