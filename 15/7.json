    "commentary": "\nIn the previous verse, Shree Krishna explained that all the perfected souls who find Him go to His Abode and never return to the material world. Now in this verse he says, but those who remain in the material world are also His An\u015bha or fragmental parts.Are the embodied souls also a part of God? To understand this, we must first look at what are the different forms in which God manifests. There are mainly two forms:Sw\u0101n\u015bh:\u00a0 All the direct forms of God, who are His integrated parts and not different from Lord Shree Krishna are called sw\u0101n\u015bh. They are also known as His Avatars such as Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, Varaha, Matsya, etc.Vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh:\u00a0 All the souls of existence come under this category; they are not directly His parts. These take form from His material energy or j\u012bva \u015bhakti. Shree Krishna had previously explained this in Verse 7.5 \u201cBut beyond the material energy, O mighty-armed Arjun, there is another superior energy of Mine.\u00a0 It is the embodied souls who are the basis of life in this world.\u201dThese vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh souls are further divided into three kinds:\u00a0Nitya Siddha:\u00a0 The liberated souls, who have always resided in the divine realm of God since eternity and participate in His divine Pastimes.S\u0101dhan Siddha:\u00a0 Those souls from the material world, who practiced s\u0101dhan\u0101 and attained the Supreme Lord.\u00a0 And now they reside in the divine realm for the rest of eternity.Nitya Baddha:\u00a0 The embodied souls who have been trapped in the material realm since eternity.\u00a0 Due to their material existence, these souls are dis-illusioned by their five senses and the mind. They are struggling in samsara; the cycle of birth and death.\u00a0The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had states:par\u0101\u00f1chi kh\u0101ni vyat\u1e5bi\u1e47at swayambh\u016b\u1e25 \u00a0\u00a0(2.1.1)\u201cThe creator, Brahma, has made the senses such that they are turned outward toward the world.\u201d\u00a0Therefore, Shree Krishna said for the vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh nitya baddha parts, \u201cBound by their material nature, these souls are struggling with the six senses including the mind.\u201d In the next verse, He explains when a soul moves from one body to another upon death, what happens to the mind and the senses.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna explains the different forms in which God manifests. Sw\u0101n\u015bh refers to the direct forms of God, such as avatars like Shree Ram, Narshingh Bhagavan, etc. Vibhinn\u0101n\u015bh refers to the souls of existence, who are not directly His parts but manifest from His material energy. These souls are further divided into three categories: Nitya Siddha, the liberated souls who reside in the divine realm; S\u0101dhan Siddha, those who attained the Supreme Lord through practice; and Nitya Baddha, the embodied souls trapped in the material realm. The struggle of the Nitya Baddha souls is due to their material existence and the influence of their senses and mind. Shree Krishna explains that these souls are bound by their material nature. In the next verse, He will elaborate on the transition of the soul from one body to another and its impact on the mind and senses."
