The followers of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga worship God as Brahman. The a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yoga seeks God as Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul who resides in the hearts of all living creatures. Whereas, Bhagav\u0101n is more personal and can be considered the sweetest among his form. Here, God manifests as a person and performs sweet Leelas (pastimes). The devotees of the Bh\u0101kti-yoga savor this form and immerse themselves in his loving bliss, as explained earlier in verse 12.2.In this chapter, Shree Krishna has described all three forms of God. But which of them is the most complete? Here, in this verse lies the answer. Shree Krishna says those who know Him as the Supreme Divine Personality and worship him as Bhagav\u0101n truly have complete knowledge of Him.Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj in his book Bhakti \u015ahatak has given a detailed explanation of why Bhagav\u0101n realization is the highest. He has quoted the same verse 1.2.11 of the Shreemad Bhagavatam and said:t\u012bna r\u016bp \u015bhr\u012b k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a ko, vedavy\u0101s bat\u0101ya,brahma aura param\u0101tm\u0101, aru bhagav\u0101n kah\u0101ya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 21)\u201cVed Vyas has declared that the Supreme Lord manifests in three ways\u2014Brahman, Param\u0101tm\u0101, and Bhagav\u0101n.\u201d\u00a0 Then he goes on to describe these three manifestations of the Absolute Truth.sarva\u015bhakti sampann ho, \u015bhakti vik\u0101sa na hoya,sat\u00a0chit\u00a0\u0101nanda r\u016bp jo, brahma kah\u0101ve soya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 22)\u201cAs Brahman, the infinite energies of God are all latent.\u00a0 He merely displays eternal knowledge and bliss.\u201dsarva\u015bhakti sanyukta ho, n\u0101ma r\u016bp gu\u1e47a hoya,l\u012bl\u0101 parikara rahit ho, param\u0101tm\u0101 hai soya.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 23)\u00a0\u201cAs Param\u0101tm\u0101, God displays His Form, Name, and Virtues.\u00a0 But He does not engage in Leelas, nor does He have associates.\u201dsarva\u015bhakti pr\u0101ka\u1e6dya ho, l\u012bl\u0101 vividha prak\u0101ra,viharata parikara sang jo, tehi bhagav\u0101n puk\u0101ra.\u00a0 \u00a0(Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 24)\u201cThe aspect of God in which He manifests all His energies and engages in various loving Pastimes with His devotees is called Bhagav\u0101n.\u201dThrough these verses, Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj has explicated that; while in His manifestation as Brahman and Param\u0101tm\u0101 God does not reveal himself completely; but as Bhagav\u0101n, He manifests himself with all his Names, Forms, Virtues, Pastimes, Abodes, and Associates.\u00a0 This complete realization of the Supreme Entity has also been explained earlier in verse 12.2, with the example of a train. Thus, those who seek God as Bhagav\u0101n, the Supreme Divine Personality can truly acquire complete knowledge of Him.\n",

These are not different entities, but different manifestations of the same God. Brahman is the formless, omnipotent, and omnipresent aspect of God, worshiped by followers of j\u00f1\u0101na-yoga. Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the Supreme Soul who resides in the hearts of all living creatures, sought by practitioners of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yoga. Bhagav\u0101n is the sweetest and most personal form of God, who engages in loving pastimes and is worshiped by devotees of Bh\u0101kti-yoga. Shree Krishna explains in verse 1.2.11 that those who know Him as Bhagav\u0101n have complete knowledge of Him.
