    "translation": "Presiding over the ear, the eye, touch, taste and smell, as well as the mind, it enjoys the objects of the senses.",
    "commentary": "\nThe soul is divine, then how does it savor the objects of the senses? With the help of the mind and the senses, it can enjoy taste, smell, touch, feel or hear sounds. Even though the mind and senses are lifeless, due to the consciousness of the soul they become lifelike. This helps them to experience pleasure and pain from their thoughts, situations, persons, and objects of the senses. Then the embodied soul identifies the same experiences of the mind and the senses as its own because of the ego.The trouble here is, that the happiness experienced through the mind and the senses is material, but the soul is divine. Hence, regardless of the amount, the soul can never be satisfied with such material pleasures. It is restless and continuously keeps searching for that ultimate source of happiness.\u00a0Ralph Waldo Emerson an American philosopher very beautifully said, \u201cWe grant that human life is mean.\u00a0 But how did we find out that it is mean?\u00a0 What is the ground of this uneasiness, of this old discontent?\u00a0 What is this universal sense of want and ignorance, but the fine innuendo by which the soul makes its enormous claim?\u201d Another famous philosopher, Meister Eckhart has written: \u201cThere is something in the soul which is above the living being, divine and simple. This light is only satisfied with the supra essential essence.\u201d\u00a0The divine bliss, which is both eternal and infinite; that the uncontended soul is continuously searching for; can only be attained from God. Those who realize that the mind and the senses are the cause of bondage, and the only way to break free is to turn these instruments of senses towards God, progresses on the path of devotion. Saint Tulsidas, the author of Ramayana in Hindi (Awadhi) is an excellent example.As a young lad, he was madly in love with his wife. Once she went for a few days to her parents\u2019 house, which was in a nearby village across a stream. At night, the weather was bad, but Tulsidas was very restless and eager to meet her. He decided to go and meet her right away. It was very dark and raining, so no boatman was willing to take him across the stream. Then he saw something floating nearby, thinking that it was a log, he clung to it and swam across.\u00a0 When he reached her house, it was late, he was hesitant to wake the entire household. His wife\u2019s room was on the second floor, he thought of calling out to her, but saw a rope hanging from her window. He caught that and went up to her room.She was astonished to see him there and enquired how he managed to come that late at night, in such terrible weather. He pointed at the window, but when they looked out of the window, both were shocked. There was no rope it was a snake, and what Tulsidas assumed to be a log, was in fact, a floating dead body. His desire for his wife was so intense that it had blinded his mind. She was furious and said to him, \u201cYou desire me, a body made of flesh and blood. If you would have such an intense desire for God, you would attain him and be free from the cycle of life and death.\u201dHer words had a life-changing effect on Tulsidas. He left home, renounced a householders\u2019 life and took up devotion. By detaching himself from the material pleasures and engaging them towards devotion to God, he went on to become a great saint and poet.\u00a0He later wrote:k\u0101mihi n\u0101ri pi\u0101ri jimi lobhihi priya jimi d\u0101ma,timi raghun\u0101tha nirantara priya l\u0101gahu mohi r\u0101ma(Ramayan)\u201cAs a lustful man desires a beautiful woman, and as an avaricious person desires wealth, may my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram.\u201d\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "The soul, although divine, experiences the objects of the senses through the mind and senses. The consciousness of the soul gives life to the mind and senses, enabling them to enjoy pleasure and pain. However, the happiness derived from material pleasures can never satisfy the divine soul. The soul constantly seeks the ultimate source of eternal and infinite bliss, which can only be attained through God. Turning the instruments of the senses towards God is the path of devotion and liberation. The story of Tulsidas, who transformed his intense desire for his wife into an intense desire for God, exemplifies this path. By renouncing material pleasures, he became a great saint and poet. Tulsidas wrote, 'May my mind and senses constantly desire Lord Ram, just as a lustful person desires a beautiful woman or an avaricious person desires wealth.'",
    "newest_commentary": "The soul experiences worldly pleasures through the mind and senses, but material happiness cannot fulfill the divine soul. The eternal and infinite bliss can only be achieved through devotion to God. Tulsidas's story demonstrates the transformation of desire from worldly to spiritual. By renouncing material pleasures, Tulsidas became a saint and poet. He wrote about desiring Lord Ram with the same intensity as a lustful person desires a beautiful woman or an avaricious person desires wealth. Turning the senses towards God is the path of devotion and liberation, leading to the ultimate source of bliss."
