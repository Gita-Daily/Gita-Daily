    "commentary": "\nHere, Lord Shree Krishna briefly describes his divine Abode, which he says is self-luminous. No sun, moon or fire is required to light it up. As the material realm is created by Maya (material energy), it is full of defects and dualities. Whereas, the divine realm is created by Yogmaya (spiritual energy), which is both transcendental and perfect. It is also described as sat-chit-\u0101nand\u00a0(full of bliss, knowledge, and eternality).The Paravyom is the spiritual sky of the divine realm. It is filled with splendor and divine opulence. It contains numerous abodes of various eternal forms of God. Narayan, Ram, Shree Krishna, etc. all have their separate Abodes.\u00a0 They reside there eternally along with their devotees and perform divine\u00a0Leelas (Pastimes). In a prayer to Shree Krishna Brahma says:goloka-n\u0101mni nija-dh\u0101mni tale cha tasyadev\u012b mahe\u015bha-hari-dh\u0101masu te\u1e63hu te\u1e63hute te prabh\u0101va-nichay\u0101 vihit\u0101\u015bh cha yenagovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 verse 43)\u201cIn the spiritual sky is Golok, the personal Abode of Shree Krishna.\u00a0 That spiritual sky also contains the Abodes of Narayan, Shiv, Durga, etc.\u00a0 I adore Supreme Divine Personality Lord Krishna, by the majesty of whose opulence, this is possible.\u201d Brahma has further described Golok in the following verse:\u0101nanda-chinmaya-rasa-pratibh\u0101vit\u0101bhist\u0101bhir ya eva nija-r\u016bpatay\u0101 kal\u0101bhi\u1e25goloka eva nivasaty akhil\u0101tma-bh\u016btogovindam \u0101di-puru\u1e63ha\u1e41 tam aha\u1e41 bhaj\u0101mi(Brahma Samhit\u0101 verse 37)\u201cI worship Govind, the Supreme Lord, who resides in Golok with the expansion of His own form, Radha.\u00a0 Their eternal Associates are the sakhis, who are enlivened by the ever-blissful spiritual energy and are the embodiments of sixty-four artistic abilities.\u201d\u00a0Shree Krishna assures Arjun that souls who attain him, reside eternally with him in His Supreme Abode, which is perfect in every way. These devotees become free from samsara the cycle of birth and death and get to participate in His Divine Leelas.\n",

Unlike the material realm created by Maya, the divine realm is created by Yogmaya and is perfect and transcendental. It is filled with splendor and divine opulence, with various eternal forms of God having their separate Abodes. The prayer by Brahma highlights Golok, the personal Abode of Shree Krishna, along with the Abodes of other deities. Golok is described as a place of eternal bliss and knowledge, where Govind and Radha reside along with their sakhis. Shree Krishna assures Arjuna that those who attain Him reside eternally with Him in His Supreme Abode, freeing themselves from the cycle of birth and death, and participating in His Divine Leelas."
