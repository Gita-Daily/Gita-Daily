    "commentary": "\nIn the previous verses, Shree Krishna spoke about the different worlds and categories of souls. Now he speaks of God - the Supreme Divine Personality called the Param\u0101tma, which means the Supreme Soul. The appellation of Param emphasizes on the fact that Param\u0101tm\u0101 is different from \u0101tm\u0101, which is an individual soul, whereas, Param\u0101tm\u0101 is the Supreme Soul. He is the transcendental God who controls both the perishable and imperishable worlds. For the non-dualistic philosophers who propagate that individual soul itself is the Supreme Soul, this verse is clear disapproval of their claim.\u00a0While the individual soul is very tiny and confined to the material body it resides in; the Supreme Soul is present inside every living entity. He is the constant companion of the individual soul in every life, immaterial of what species the soul gets born into. He sits in their hearts quietly taking a note; keeping an account of their karmas, and gives appropriate results.\u00a0 For example, in a particular birth, a soul has received a dog\u2019s body. The Supreme Soul continues to be inside and gives results based on the soul\u2019s past karmas. This explains why even dogs have different destinies. Some dogs are born on the streets, live a famished life, and die in misery. Whereas, some get to live comfortably as pets in lavish mansions, living a dainty life. This huge difference in destiny is due to the stockpile of karmas from their previous births. The Supreme Soul which accompanies the soul in its various births, in different species, keeps granting results based on its karmas.The Supreme Soul also exists in a personal form as the four-armed Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, commonly known as \u201cBhagwan Vishnu\u201d. A popular saying in Hindi goes: \u201cm\u0101rane v\u0101le ke do h\u0101th, bach\u0101ne v\u0101le ke ch\u0101r h\u0101th\u201d which means, a killer has two arms, but the savior has four arms.\u00a0 The four-armed personality referred to here is the Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna explains the concept of God as the Supreme Soul, different from individual souls. He controls both perishable and imperishable worlds and is present inside every living entity. While the individual soul is confined to the material body, the Supreme Soul accompanies it in every life and keeps a record of its karmas. Dogs with different destinies exemplify the results of past karmas. The Supreme Soul exists in a personal form as the four-armed Kshirodakshayi Vishnu, known as Bhagwan Vishnu. The saying 'a killer has two arms, but the savior has four arms' refers to the four-armed Param\u0101tm\u0101, the Supreme Soul."
