The common flaw with the human approach is that we tend to use our material senses to understand the divine. We want to decide the correctness and faults in knowledge with our intellect, which has only worldly but no experience of the divine. We believe that things which cannot be perceived by the mind and the senses do not exist.This approach is well elucidated by Noble laureate and French physiologist, Alexis Carrel. In his book, Man the Unknown, he states: \u201cOur mind has a natural tendency to reject the things that do not fit into the frame of scientific or philosophical beliefs of our time.\u00a0 After all, scientists are only human.\u00a0\u00a0 They are saturated with the prejudices of their environment and epoch.\u00a0 They willingly believe that facts which cannot be explained by current theories do not exist.\u00a0 At present times, scientists still look upon telepathy and other metaphysical phenomena as illusions.\u00a0 Evident facts having an unorthodox appearance are suppressed.\u201dAccording to Ny\u0101ya Dar\u015bhan, one of the ancient schools of Hindu philosophy, such thinking is called k\u016bpa-ma\u1e47\u1e0d\u016bka-ny\u0101ya (the logic of a well-frog).\u00a0 The story behind this is of a frog which has been living within the walls of a well, unaware of the world outside. Once an ocean frog gets washed off and falls into that well. The well-frog enquires to the newcomer, \u201cHow big is the ocean, where you lived?\u201d The ocean frog replied, \u201cIt is huge.\u201d The well-frog said, \u201cIt must be 5 times bigger than this well.\u201d To this, the ocean frog said, \u201cNo much bigger than that.\u201d The well-frog said, \u201cIs it 10 times bigger?\u201d \u201cMuch more than that,\u201d said the ocean frog. The well-frog was now curious and said, \u201cA hundred times?\u201d To this, the ocean frog replied, \u201cA hundred is nothing, the ocean is much bigger than that.\u201d The frog from the well did not believe the ocean frog and said, \u201cYou are a liar, how can any place be a hundred times bigger than my well?\u201d The well-frog had been living there its whole life, it had not seen anything beyond the walls of that well. Therefore, its mind could not comprehend the idea of a vast ocean, or the world that existed outside of that well.Like the frog of the well, materialistic people cannot perceive the idea of an eternal soul. Due to their limited experience and lack of spiritual knowledge, they cannot perceive that there is an entire spiritual universe beyond the understanding of their material intellects. Only those who have taken the path of spirituality, endeavor to purify their hearts with humility and faith. A cleansed mind naturally experiences the presence of the soul. Then the knowledge of the scriptures becomes clear to them.Similar to the existence of the soul, the senses cannot perceive the existence of God as well. Only through the eyes of knowledge can one realize God. In the next verse, Shree Krishna has briefed on the method of perceiving the existence of God.\n", "next shlok": 12}
