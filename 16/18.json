Although they do not possess righteous qualities themselves, they enjoy finding fault in everyone else. They consider themselves all-important, and as a consequence of this nature of self-aggrandizement, they are envious of other\u2019s success. If ever they are opposed in their schemes, they become enraged and cause agony to others as well as to their own selves. Consequently, they disregard and disrespect the Supreme Soul who is seated within their own hearts and the hearts of others.\n",
