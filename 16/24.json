    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna now gives the final conclusion of the teachings in this chapter. By comparing and differentiating between the divine and demoniac natures, he highlighted how the demoniac nature leads to hellish existence. Thus, he established that nothing is to be gained by discarding the injunctions of the scriptures. Now he drives home the point by stating that the absolute authority in ascertaining the propriety of any activity, or lack of it, are the Vedic scriptures.\nSometimes, even well-intentioned people say, \u201cI do not care for rules. I follow my heart and do my own thing.\u201d It is all very well to follow the heart, but how can they be sure that their heart is not misleading them? As the saying goes, \u201cThe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\u201d Thus, it is always wise to check with the scriptures whether our heart is truly guiding us in the proper direction. The Manu Sm\u1e5biti states:\nbh\u016bta\u1e41 bhavya\u1e41 bhavi\u1e63hya\u1e41 cha sarva\u1e41 ved\u0101t prasidhyati (12.97)[v12]\n\u201cThe authenticity of any spiritual principle of the past, present, or future, must be established on the basis of the Vedas.\u201d Hence, Shree Krishna concludes by instructing Arjun to comprehend the teachings of the scriptures and act according to them.\n",

He compares the divine and demoniac natures, showing how the latter leads to a hellish existence. He cautions against disregarding rules and following one's own heart, as good intentions can still lead to misguidance. Shree Krishna states that the Vedic scriptures hold absolute authority in determining the propriety of our actions. He cites the Manu Sm\u1e5biti, which asserts that the authenticity of any spiritual principle must be based on the Vedas.
