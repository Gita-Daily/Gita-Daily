    "newest_commentary": "The pursuit of wealth is driven by insatiable desires, leading people to adopt unethical means of accumulating money. According to the Bhagavad Gita, one should only keep as much wealth as necessary and give the rest in charity. Those who hoard wealth beyond their needs are considered thieves by God and will be punished. At the time of death, their accumulated wealth will be taken away, and they will face karmic consequences for their unethical actions. Similar to a smuggler losing both goods and facing legal consequences, those who amass wealth unlawfully will suffer double punishment for their misconduct."
