    "commentary": "\nScriptures are the guide maps given to humans on the journey toward enlightenment. They provide us with knowledge and understanding. They also give us instructions on what to do and what not to do. These instructions are of two kinds\u2014vidhi and ni\u1e63hedh. The directives to perform certain activities are called vidhi. The directives not to perform certain activities are called ni\u1e63hedh. By faithfully following both these kinds of injunctions, human beings can proceed toward perfection. But the ways of the demoniac are the reverse of the teachings of the scriptures. They engage in prohibited acts and refrain from recommended ones. Referring to such people, Shree Krishna declares that those who renounce the authorized path and act according to their whims, impelled by the impulses of their desires, achieve neither true knowledge, nor the perfection of happiness, nor liberation from material bondage.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "The scriptures provide guidance on the path to enlightenment, offering knowledge and instructions. They include directives to perform certain activities (vidhi) and refrain from others (ni\u1e63hedh). Following these instructions leads to perfection. In contrast, the demoniac oppose the scriptures, engaging in prohibited acts and neglecting recommended ones. Those who renounce the authorized path and act according to their desires do not attain true knowledge, happiness, or liberation from material bondage."
