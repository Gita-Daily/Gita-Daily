    "commentary": "\nIgnoring all morality, the demoniac presume they have a right to enjoy whatever they find pleasurable. They make concerted efforts to orchestrate events to fulfill their ambitions. Realizing that the ritualistic practices of the Vedas will help them become materially affluent, they even perform ritualistic ceremonies to accrue abundance and fame from them. However, like the vulture that flies high but keeps its sight fixed low, the demoniac sometimes rise in social status, but their actions remain mean and lowly. Such people respect power and believe in the principle of \u201cmight is right.\u201d Hence, they do not hesitate in even harming or injuring others to eliminate obstacles in the fulfillment of their desires. The Sukti Sudhakar states that there are four kinds of people:eke satpuru\u1e63\u0101\u1e25 par\u0101rthagha\u1e6dak\u0101\u1e25 sw\u0101rth\u0101n parityajya yes\u0101m\u0101ny\u0101stu par\u0101rthamudyamabh\u1e5bita\u1e25 sw\u0101rth\u0101 virodhena yete \u2019m\u012b m\u0101nav r\u0101k\u1e63as\u0101\u1e25 parahita\u1e41 sw\u0101rth\u0101ya nighnanti yeye tughnanti nirarthaka\u1e41 parahita\u1e43 te ke na j\u0101n\u012bmahe [v5]\u201cThe first kind of people is the saintly personalities who sacrifice their self-interest for the welfare of others. The second kind is common people who believe in engaging in the welfare of others, provided it does not harm them. The third kind is the demoniac who do not mind harming others, if it helps fulfill their self-interest. There is also a fourth kind of people who harm others, for no reason (except sadistic delight). There is no suitable name for them.\u201d Shree Krishna vividly describes the degraded nature of the demoniac-mentality. Blinded by pride, they think along these lines: \u201cI was born in a wealthy and aristocratic family. I am rich and powerful, and I do what I like. There is no need for me to bow down before God because I am like God myself.\u201dIn most cases, when people say \u201cI,\u201d it is their ego speaking, not them. The ego contains personal identifications with opinions, external appearances, resentments, etc. This ego builds a personality of its own, and under its sway, people identify with thoughts, emotions, and bundles of memories, which they see as integral parts of themselves. The ego identifies with owning, but the satisfaction of having is usually short-lived. Concealed within it is a deep-rooted dissatisfaction of \u201cnot enough.\u201d This unfulfilled want results in unease, restlessness, boredom, anxiety, and dissatisfaction. Consequently, a much distorted perception of reality is created, which further alienates their perception of \u201cI\u201d from the real self.The ego creates the biggest untruth in our lives, and makes us believe what we are not. Thus, for progress along the saintly path, all the religious traditions and saints urge us to dismantle our egotistic thought patterns. The Tao Te Ching teaches: \u201cInstead of trying to be the mountain, be the valley of the Universe.\u201d [v6] (Chapter 6) Jesus of Nazareth also stated: \u201cWhen you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place so that when the host comes, he may say to you, friend, move up higher. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and everyone who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d (Luke 14:10-11)[v7]. Saint Kabir put this very nicely:\u016b\u00f1che p\u0101n\u012b na \u1e6dike, n\u012bche h\u012b \u1e6dhahar\u0101yen\u012bch\u0101 hoya so bhari p\u012b, \u016b\u00f1ch\u0101 py\u0101s\u0101 j\u0101ya [v8]\u201cWater does not remain above; it naturally flows down. Those who are low and unassuming drink (God\u2019s grace) to their heart\u2019s content, while those who are high and pompous remain thirsty.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary highlights the demoniac mentality and lack of morality, with individuals prioritizing their own enjoyment and manipulating situations for their ambitions. They pursue material wealth through rituals, remaining selfish and using power to fulfill desires. Four types of people are identified: saints prioritize others' welfare, common people seek welfare without harm, demons harm others for self-interest, and a group harms others without reason. Ego distorts perception and causes restlessness. Religious traditions emphasize eliminating ego for spiritual growth and divine grace.",
