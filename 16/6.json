    "commentary": "\nAll souls carry their natures with them from past lives. Accordingly, those cultivated virtuous qualities and performed meritorious deeds in the past lives are the ones who are born with divine natures, while those who indulged in sin and defiled their minds in previous lives carry the same tendencies into the present one. This explains the varieties of natures of living beings in the world. The divine and demoniac natures are the two extremes of this spectrum.\nThe living beings in the celestial abodes possess more virtuous qualities, while the demoniac traits dominate in the lower abodes. Humans possess a mixture of both divine and demoniac traits. Even in the cruelest butcher, we sometimes find the quality of kindness existing in personal life. And even in elevated spiritual aspirants we find defects of virtue. It is said that in Satya-yug, the gods and demons lived on different planets (i.e., separate planes of existence); in Tret\u0101-yug, they resided on the same planet; during Dw\u0101par-yug, they lived in the same family; and in Kali-yug, the godly and demoniac natures coexist in the same person\u2019s heart. That is the dilemma of human existence, where the higher self pulls it upward toward God, while the lower self pulls it downward. Having described the saintly qualities, Shree Krishna now goes into an extended description of the lower nature, to help us recognize it and avoid it.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the nature of each soul is a result of their actions in past lives. Those who have cultivated virtuous qualities are born with divine natures, while those who have indulged in sin carry the same tendencies into their present life, resulting in demoniac natures. The celestial beings possess more virtuous qualities, while the lower beings exhibit more demoniac traits. Humans have a mixture of both divine and demoniac traits. The commentary highlights that even the cruelest individuals may possess kindness, and even elevated spiritual aspirants may have flaws. It is explained that in different ages, gods and demons lived separately, then together on the same planet, in the same family, and now in the same person's heart. This dilemma of human existence is characterized by the constant struggle between the higher self pulling towards God and the lower self pulling downward. The commentary concludes by emphasizing the importance of recognizing and avoiding the lower nature.",
