As long as these are present, one is attracted toward preya, or happiness that seems sweet in the present but becomes bitter in the end. But when materialistic yearnings diminish, the intellect, free\u00a0from the material mode of passion, is able to perceive the shortsightedness of pursuing the path of preya. Then one gets drawn toward shreya, or happiness that is unpleasant in the present but becomes sweet in the end. And for those attracted to shreya, the path of enlightenment opens up. They begin endeavoring for the eternal welfare of their soul, thereby moving toward the supreme goal.\n", "next shlok": 23}
