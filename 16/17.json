    "newest_commentary": "Virtuous people perform sacrifices to purify themselves and please God, while demoniac people perform grandiose rituals for personal gain and to appear pious in society. However, their impure intentions and failure to follow scripture make their sacrifices invalid. The scriptures emphasize that the merit of a good deed decreases when it is advertised and increases when kept a secret. Shree Krishna criticizes the demoniac's incorrect performance of ritualistic ceremonies. This highlights the importance of performing sacrifices with a pure heart and following the true teachings of the scriptures."
