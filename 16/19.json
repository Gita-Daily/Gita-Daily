    "translation": "Those cruel haters, worst among men in the world, I hurl those evil-doers into the wombs of demons only.Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded, birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that.",
    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna once again describes the repercussions of the demoniac mentality. He says that in their next lives, he gives them birth in families with similar mentalities, where they get a suitable demoniac environment to exercise their free will and heartily vent their degraded nature. From this verse, we can also infer that it is not in the soul\u2019s hands to choose the species, abode, and environment of its next birth. God makes this decision according to the nature and karma of the individual. Thus, the demoniac are sent into lower and degraded wombs, even to the level of snakes, lizards, and scorpions, which are receptacles for the evil-minded.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that those with a demoniac mentality are reborn in families and environments that reflect their degraded nature. This shows that individuals have no control over the species and abode of their next birth; God decides based on their nature and karma. The demoniac may be reborn in lower forms such as snakes and lizards, symbolizing their evil mindset."
