    "new_commentary": "The material energy is inert and lacks consciousness. However, when inspired by God, it acts as if sentient. This is similar to tongs in the hands of a chef. Although the material energy alone cannot create, when God desires to create, He animates it. While God is the creator, He remains unaffected by the material energy's work, being blissful in Himself. He is known as \u0101tm\u0101r\u0101m, rejoicing in Himself without external pleasures. Additionally, God clarifies that He is the non-doer and the Supervisor.",
