    "commentary": "\nDevotees can only be elevated to the level of the entity they worship, just as water in a pipe can only rise to the level of the reservoir to which it is connected.\u00a0 In this verse, Shree Krishna explains the implications of worshipping different entities by revealing the varieties of destinations attained.\u00a0 He gives this knowledge to help us conclude that to reach the highest level of spiritual evolution we must worship the Supreme.\u00a0The worshippers of Indra (the rain god),\u00a0Kuber (the god of wealth), Agni (the god of fire), etc. go to the celestial abodes.\u00a0 Then, when their account of good karmas gets depleted, they are sent back from heaven.\u00a0 The Pitars are the ancestors.\u00a0 It is good to harbor thoughts of gratefulness toward them, but undue concern with their welfare is detrimental.\u00a0 Those who engage in the ancestor worship go to the abodes of their ancestors after death.\u00a0Those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits.\u00a0 In the Western world, there is witchcraft; in Africa, there is black magic; in India, there are v\u0101m-marg t\u0101ntrics, who invoke ghosts and spirits.\u00a0 Shree Krishna says that persons who indulge in such things take birth amongst ghosts and spirits in their next life.The highest devotees are those who attach their minds to the Supreme Divine Personality.\u00a0 The word vrata means resolve and undertaking.\u00a0 Such fortunate souls, who firmly resolve to worship God and engage steadfastly in His devotion, go to His divine Abode after death.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, it is explained that devotees are elevated to the level of the entity they worship. Worshipping different entities leads to different destinations. Worshippers of Indra, Kuber, Agni, etc., go to celestial abodes but are eventually sent back to earth. Ancestor worship leads to rebirth in the abodes of ancestors. Those in the mode of ignorance worship ghosts and spirits, and they are reborn as such in their next life. The highest devotees are those who attach their minds to the Supreme Divine Personality. They firmly resolve to worship God and go to His divine Abode after death.",
