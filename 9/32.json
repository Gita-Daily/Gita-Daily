    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, it is explained that some souls are born in pious families due to their past good deeds, while others are born in families of wrongdoers due to their past sins. However, Shree Krishna states that regardless of one's birth, gender, caste, or race, anyone who takes complete shelter of Him will attain the supreme goal. This shows the greatness of the path of devotion, which is open to all, unlike other paths with strict eligibility criteria. The commentary also highlights the qualifications required for practicing the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog, the six conditions for performing Vedic rituals, and the regulations for a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g-yog. In contrast, bhakti-yog, the path of devotion, can be practiced by anyone, anywhere, at any time, and using any material. God is only concerned with the love in our hearts and is willing to accept everyone with genuine love, as all souls are His children.",
