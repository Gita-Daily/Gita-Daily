    "commentary": "\nHow can devotees be considered venerable, merely for having made the correct resolve?\u00a0 Shree Krishna explains that if they continue the process of exclusive devotion with unflinching faith in God, their hearts will become purified and they will swiftly develop saintly virtues.\u00a0Divine virtues emanate from God Himself.\u00a0 He is perfectly just, truthful, compassionate, loving, merciful, etc.\u00a0 Since we souls are His tiny parts, we are all naturally drawn to these godly qualities.\u00a0 But the process of becoming virtuous remains an elusive mystery.\u00a0 From childhood, we have heard that we must speak the truth, serve others, be free from anger, etc. and yet we are unable to put those teachings into practice for the simple reason that our mind is impure.\u00a0 Without purification of the mind, blemishes of character cannot be eradicated fully and permanently.\u00a0 Jagadguru Shree Kripaluji Maharaj declares the irrefutable truth regarding developing divine virtues:satya ahins\u0101 \u0101di mana! bina hari bhajana na p\u0101yajala te gh\u1e5bita nikale nah\u012b\u00f1, ko\u1e6dina kariya up\u0101ya\u00a0\u00a0 (Bhakti \u015ahatak verse 35)\u201cOil stains on a cloth cannot be removed by water, no matter how much we try.\u00a0 Similarly, truthfulness, non-violence, and other virtuous qualities cannot be acquired without engaging in devotion to God.\u201d\u00a0 These qualities manifest when the mind is purified; and the purification of the mind cannot take place without attaching it to the all-pure God.\u00a0Further, Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish.\u00a0 He does not say, \u201cThe j\u00f1\u0101n\u012b (person of knowledge) will not be lost.\u201d\u00a0 Nor does He say, \u201cThe karm\u012b (performer of rituals) shall not perish.\u201d\u00a0 He makes His promise for His bhaktas (devotees), saying that \u201cthey shall never come to ruin.\u201d\u00a0 Thereby, He reiterates what He had stated in verse 9.22, that He personally carries the burden of maintaining those who depend upon Him and engage in exclusive devotion unto Him.It may seem intriguing why Shree Krishna asks Arjun to make this statement, instead of declaring it Himself?\u00a0 The reason is that under special circumstances the Lord sometimes breaks His word, but He never permits His devotees\u2019 word to be broken.\u00a0 For example, Shree Krishna had resolved that He would not lift weapons during the Mahabharat war.\u00a0 But when Bheeshma, considered the perfect devotee, resolved that he would either kill Arjun by sunset the next day or make the Lord lift weapons to protect him, Shree Krishna broke His own vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma.\u00a0 Thus, to reaffirm the strength of His statement, Shree Krishna here says, \u201cArjun, you declare that My devotee will never perish, for I shall guarantee that your word will be kept.\u201d\u00a0\n",

Divine virtues emanate from God Himself, and the purification of the mind is essential to acquire these virtues. Shree Krishna asks Arjun to boldly declare that His devotees will never perish, reaffirming His promise to personally maintain those who depend on Him and engage in exclusive devotion. The Lord sometimes breaks His own word but never permits His devotees' word to be broken. The reason for asking Arjun to make this statement is to emphasize the strength of the promise. In a particular instance, Shree Krishna broke His vow to protect the vow made by Bheeshma, the perfect devotee. Therefore, Shree Krishna assures Arjun that his declaration of the eternal protection of His devotees will be kept by the Lord himself.",
