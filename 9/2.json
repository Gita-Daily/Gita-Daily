    "commentary": "\nR\u0101ja means \u201cking.\u201d\u00a0 Shree Krishna uses the metaphor r\u0101ja to emphasize the paramount position of the knowledge He is going to reveal.\u00a0Vidy\u0101 means \u201cscience.\u201d\u00a0 He does not refer to His teachings as creed, religion, dogma, doctrine, or belief.\u00a0 He declares that what He is going to describe to Arjun is the king of sciences.\u00a0Guhya means \u201csecret.\u201d\u00a0 This knowledge is also the supreme secret.\u00a0 Since love is only possible where there is a choice, God deliberately hides Himself from direct perception, thereby providing the soul the freedom to exercise the choice of loving Him or not.\u00a0 A machine cannot love, for it is devoid of choices.\u00a0 God wants us to love Him and so He gives us the option to choose Him or not, as we wish.\u00a0 He merely makes us aware of the consequences of what we choose, either way, and then leaves it to us to decide the path we wish to follow.Pavitram means \u201cpure.\u201d\u00a0 Knowledge of devotion is supremely pure because it is untainted by petty selfishness.\u00a0 It inspires sacrifice of the self at the altar of divine love for the Supreme Lord.\u00a0 Bhakti also purifies the devotee by destroying p\u0101p, b\u012bja, and avidy\u0101.\u00a0 P\u0101p is the stockpile of past sins of endless lifetimes of the individual soul.\u00a0 Bhakti burns them up as a fire burns up a bundle of straw.\u00a0 B\u012bja refers to impurities of the heart, which are the seeds of sinful activities.\u00a0 If the seeds exist, then destroying the results of past sins will not suffice, for the propensity to sin will remain in the heart and one will sin again.\u00a0 Bhakti purifies the heart and destroys the seeds of sin, which are lust, anger, and greed.\u00a0 However, even the destruction of the seeds is not enough.\u00a0 The reason why the heart becomes impure is that there is avidy\u0101 (ignorance), because of which we identify with the body.\u00a0 Because of this misidentification, we think of the body as the self, and hence create bodily desires thinking they will give happiness to the self.\u00a0 Fulfillment of such material desires further leads to lust, anger, greed, and all the other impurities of the heart.\u00a0 As long as the ignorance remains, even if the heart is cleansed, it will again become impure.\u00a0 Devotion ultimately results in realized knowledge of the soul and God, which in turn destroys the ignorance of material existence.\u00a0 The benefits of bhakti are described in the Bhakti Ras\u0101m\u1e5bit Sindhu as follows:\u00a0 kle\u015bhas tu p\u0101pa\u1e41 tadb\u012bjam avidy\u0101 cheti te tridh\u0101\u00a0 (1.1.18)\u00a0 \u201cBhakti destroys the three poisons\u2014p\u0101p (sins), b\u012bja (the seed of sins), avidy\u0101 (the ignorance in the heart).\u201d\u00a0 Only when the three are completely destroyed, does the heart become truly and permanently pure.\u00a0Pratyak\u1e63ha means \u201cdirectly perceptible.\u201d\u00a0 The practice of the science of bhakti begins with a leap of faith and results in direct perception of God.\u00a0 It is not unlike the methodology of other sciences, where we begin an experiment with a hypothesis and conclude with a verified result.\u00a0Dharmyam means \u201cvirtuous.\u201d\u00a0 Devotion performed without desire for material rewards is the most virtuous action.\u00a0 It is continuously nourished by righteous acts such as service to the Guru.\u00a0Kartum susukham means \u201cvery easy to practice.\u201d\u00a0 God does not need anything from us; He is attained very naturally if we can learn to love Him.\u00a0When this is the sovereign science and it is easy to practice, then why do people not apply themselves to learning it?\u00a0 Shree Krishna explains this next.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna emphasizes the importance of the knowledge He is going to reveal by calling it the king of sciences. This knowledge is a supreme secret, as God hides Himself from direct perception to allow the freedom to choose to love Him or not. Devotion is described as supremely pure, inspiring sacrifice and purifying the devotee by destroying past sins and impurities of the heart. Bhakti also destroys ignorance, leading to the realization of the soul and God. The practice of bhakti begins with faith and results in direct perception of God. Devotion performed without material desires is the most virtuous action and is easy to practice. Despite its significance and ease, people often do not apply themselves to learning this sovereign science.",
