    "commentary": "\nEvery action has defects, just as fire is covered by smoke.\u00a0 When we walk on the earth, we unknowingly kill millions of tiny living entities.\u00a0 In our occupational duties, no matter how careful we are in the fulfillment of our duties, we still end up harming the environment and hurting others.\u00a0 Even if we eat a cup of yogurt, we still incur the sin of destroying the living entities that reside in it.\u00a0 Some religious sects try to reduce this involuntary killing by tying a cloth over their mouth.\u00a0 Even this does not fully eliminate the destruction of living entities in our breath.\u00a0When we perform our actions with the intention of fulfilling our self-interest, we are culpable for the sins we commit, knowingly or unknowingly.\u00a0 In accordance with the law of karma, we have to reap their karmic reactions.\u00a0 Good works can also be binding because they oblige the soul to go to the celestial abodes to enjoy their results.\u00a0 Thus, both bad and good karmas result in the continuity of the cycle of birth and death.\u00a0\u00a0 However, in this verse, Shree Krishna gives a simple solution for destroying all karmic reactions of work.\u00a0 He uses the word sany\u0101s yog, meaning renunciation of selfishness.\u00a0 He says that when we dedicate our actions for the pleasure of the Lord, we are freed from the fetters of both good and bad results.\u00a0Those who establish themselves in such consciousness are called yog yukt\u0101tm\u0101 (united in consciousness with God).\u00a0 Such yogis become j\u012bvan mukt (liberated in consciousness) even in this body.\u00a0 And, upon leaving their mortal frame, they receive a divine body and eternal service in the divine Abode of God.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, it is explained that every action we perform has some unintended negative consequences. Even our smallest actions, like walking or eating, result in harm to living beings. The voluntary or involuntary destruction of life forces us to bear the karmic reactions. Good deeds can also bind us to the cycle of birth and death. However, Lord Krishna offers a solution to break free from this cycle through the practice of sany\u0101s yog, which signifies renunciation of selfishness. By dedicating our actions to the pleasure of the Lord, we are liberated from the consequences of both good and bad deeds. Those who attain this consciousness are called yog yukt\u0101tm\u0101, united in consciousness with God. They become liberated even while living in this mortal body and attain a divine body and eternal service in God's divine abode after death.",
