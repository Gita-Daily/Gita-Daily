    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna emphasizes that not only objects but also actions should be offered to Him. Devotion is not limited to the temple room; it should be a part of every moment of life. According to Sage Narad, devotion means offering every activity to God and feeling intense separation if we forget Him. This attitude transforms mundane activities into divine service. Swami Vivekananda and Saint Kabir also emphasized the unity of work and devotion. The verse 'k\u0101yena v\u0101ch\u0101 manasendriyair v\u0101...' from the Bhagavatam states that everything one does should be offered to the Supreme Lord. However, this offering should not be done at the end of the work but should be maintained throughout the action itself. Shree Krishna then mentions the benefits of offering all works to Him, which will be discussed further."
