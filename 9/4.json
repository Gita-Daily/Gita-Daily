    "new_commentary": "The Vedic philosophy emphasizes that God is all-pervading and present everywhere in the world. It rejects the idea of God creating the world and merely observing it from a distance. Some believe that the world is a transformation of God, like milk turning into yogurt through contact with acid. Others argue that the world is a mistaken perception, where what we see as the world is actually Brahman (God). However, verses 7.4 and 7.5 of the Bhagavad Gita state that the world is created from God's material energy, Maya shakti, while souls are His superior energy, Jiva shakti. Both the world and the souls exist within God's personality. However, Shree Krishna also clarifies that God is not contained by the living beings, as He is much greater than the sum total of the two energies. Just like waves are part of the ocean but the ocean surpasses them, the souls and Maya exist within God but He transcends them."
