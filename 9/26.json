    "commentary": "\nHaving established the benefits of worshipping the Supreme, Shree Krishna now explains how easy it is to do so.\u00a0 In the worship of the devat\u0101s and the ancestors, there are many rules to propitiate them, which must be strictly followed.\u00a0 But God accepts anything that is offered with a loving heart.\u00a0 If you have only a fruit, offer it to God, and He will be pleased.\u00a0 If there is no fruit available, offer Him a flower.\u00a0 If it is not the season for flowers, offer God a mere leaf; even that will suffice, provided it is a gift of love.\u00a0 If leaves are also scarce, make an offering of water, which is available everywhere, but ensure again that you do it with devotion.\u00a0 The word bhakty\u0101 has been used in both the first and second lines of the verse.\u00a0 It is the bhakti of the devotee that is pleasing to God, and not the worth of the offering.By making this wonderful statement, Shree Krishna reveals the merciful divine nature of God.\u00a0 He is not concerned with the material value of our offering.\u00a0 Rather, He values, above everything else, the love with which we make the offering.\u00a0 Thus, the Hari Bhakti Vilas states:tulas\u012b-dala-m\u0101tre\u1e47a jalasya chulukena chavikr\u012b\u1e47\u012bte svam \u0101tm\u0101na\u1e41 bhaktebhyo bhakta-vatsala\u1e25\u00a0 \u00a0(11.261)\u201cIf you offer God with sincere love, just a Tuls\u012b leaf and as much water as you can hold in your palm, He will offer Himself to you in return because He is endeared by love.\u201d\u00a0 How wonderful it is that the Supreme Master of unlimited universes, whose glorious qualities and virtues are amazing beyond description, and by whose mere thought multitudes of universes come into existence and disappear again, accepts even the most humble offering of His devotee that is given with genuine love.\u00a0 The word used here is prayat\u0101tmana\u1e25, implying, \u201cI accept the offerings of those whose hearts are pure.\u201dThe Shreemad Bhagavatam contains exactly the same verse as the above verse of the Bhagavad Gita.\u00a0 While eating dry rice at the house of His friend, Sudama, Shree Krishna said:patra\u1e41 pu\u1e63hpa\u1e41 phala\u1e41 toya\u1e41 yo me bhakty\u0101 prayachchhatitadaha\u1e41 bhaktyupah\u1e5bitam a\u015bhn\u0101mi prayat\u0101tmana\u1e25\u00a0\u00a0 (10.81.4)\u201cIf one offers Me with devotion, a leaf, a flower, a fruit, or even water, I delightfully partake of that article offered with love by My devotee in pure consciousness.\u201dWhenever God descends upon the earth, He exhibits this quality in His divine Pastimes.\u00a0 Before the Mahabharat war, when Shree Krishna went to Hastinapur to explore the possibility of fashioning an agreement between the Kauravas and Pandavas, the evil Duryodhan had proudly prepared for Him a meal with fifty-six different items.\u00a0 However, Shree Krishna rejected his hospitality and instead went to the humble hut of Vidurani, who had been longing deeply for the opportunity to serve her beloved Lord.\u00a0 Vidurani was overjoyed on receiving the Supreme Lord at her home.\u00a0 All she had to offer was bananas, but her intellect so benumbed with loving sentiments that she did not even realize she was dropping the fruit and putting the banana peels in His mouth.\u00a0 Nevertheless, seeing her devotion, Shree Krishna blissfully ate the peels, as if they were the most delicious food in the world.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that worshiping the Supreme is easy and does not require elaborate offerings. God values the love and devotion with which we make the offering, regardless of its material worth. One can offer a fruit, a flower, a leaf, or even water, as long as it is given with love. The verse emphasizes that it is the devotion of the devotee that pleases God, not the worth of the offering. This reveals the merciful nature of God, who accepts even the most humble offering if it is given with genuine love. The example of Vidurani, who offered only bananas to Shree Krishna but her love and devotion touched His heart, is given as an illustration. This quality of accepting offerings with love is exhibited by God in His divine pastimes when He descends upon the earth.",
