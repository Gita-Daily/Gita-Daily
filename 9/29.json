    "commentary": "\nWe all intuitively believe that if there is a God, He must be perfectly just; there cannot be an unjust God.\u00a0 People suffering injustice in the world make statements such as, \u201cMr. Billionaire, you have the power of money on your side. Do what you like.\u00a0 God will settle our dispute.\u00a0 He is watching and will definitely punish you.\u00a0 You cannot escape.\u201d\u00a0 This sort of statement does not indicate that the person making it is a saint, possessing absolute faith in God, for even common persons believe that God is perfectly just.\u00a0However, the previous verse by Shree Krishna creates the doubt that God is partial toward His devotees, because while everyone is subject to the law of karma, God releases His devotees from it.\u00a0 Isn\u2019t this symptomatic of the defect of partiality?\u00a0 Shree Krishna feels it necessary to clarify this point and begins the verse by saying samo\u2019 ham, meaning, \u201cNo, no, I am equal to all.\u00a0 But I have a uniform law in accordance with which I bestow My grace.\u201d\u00a0 This law was previously stated in verse 4.11: \u201cIn whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows my path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha.\u201dThe rainwater falls equally upon the earth.\u00a0 Yet, the drop that falls on the cornfields gets converted into grain; the drop that falls on the desert bush gets converted into a thorn; the drop that falls in the gutter becomes dirty water; and the drop that falls in the oyster becomes a pearl.\u00a0 There is no partiality on the part of the rain, since it is equitable in bestowing its grace upon the land.\u00a0 The raindrops cannot be held responsible for this variation in results, which are a consequence of the nature of the recipient.\u00a0 Similarly, God states here that He is equally disposed toward all living beings, and yet, those who do not love Him are bereft of the benefits of His grace because their hearts are unsuitable vessels for receiving it.\u00a0 So, what can people do whose hearts are impure?\u00a0 Shree Krishna now reveals the purifying power of bhakti.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary discusses the belief in a just God and explores the perception of God's partiality towards His devotees. The verse clarifies that God is equal to all but follows a uniform law in bestowing His grace. It compares this to rainwater falling equally on the earth, but the result varies based on the qualities of the recipient. God is equally disposed towards all living beings, but those who do not love Him do not receive the benefits of His grace due to their impure hearts. The commentary then introduces the purifying power of bhakti, highlighting its ability to cleanse impurities and bring people closer to God.",
