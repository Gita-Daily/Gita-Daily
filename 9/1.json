    "new_commentary": "In the given commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna emphasizes the qualification for hearing His teachings, which is being non-envious. He clarifies that He is revealing this knowledge because Arjun is non-envious of Him. The attitude of deriding Krishna or thinking He is boasting will not benefit listeners and will rob them of devotional reverence. God praises Himself to enhance devotion, not out of conceit. Jesus, as a true Guru, spoke motivated by compassion for his disciples. Arjun's magnanimous and envy-free nature makes him qualified for the profound knowledge Krishna is going to reveal. The knowledge of the soul, Krishna's powers, and pure bhakti are successively more secret and will be revealed in subsequent chapters of the Gita."
