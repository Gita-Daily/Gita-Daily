    "commentary": "\nSince the soul is a tiny part of God, its every relationship is with Him.\u00a0 However, in bodily consciousness, we look upon the relatives of the body as our father, mother, beloved, child, and friend.\u00a0 We become attached to them and repeatedly bring them to our mind, thereby getting further bound in the material illusion.\u00a0 But none of these worldly relatives can give us the perfect love that our soul yearns for.\u00a0 This is for two reasons.\u00a0 Firstly, these relationships are temporary, and separation is unavoidable when either they or we depart from the world.\u00a0 Secondly, even as long as they are alive, the attachment is based on selfishness and so it fluctuates in direct proportion to the extent by which self-interest is satisfied.\u00a0 Thus, the range and intensity of worldly love varies from moment to moment, throughout the day.\u00a0 \u201cMy wife is very nice\u2026.she is not so nice\u2026she is ok\u2026.she is terrible,\u201d this is the extent of fluctuation of love in the drama of the world.\u00a0 On the other hand, God is such a relative who has accompanied us lifetime after lifetime.\u00a0 From birth to birth, in every life-form that we went, God accompanied us and remained seated in our heart.\u00a0 He is thus our eternal relative.\u00a0 In addition, He has no self-interest from us; He is perfect and complete in Himself.\u00a0 He loves us selflessly, for He only desires our eternal welfare.\u00a0 Thus, God alone is our perfect relative, who is both eternal and selfless.To understand this concept from another perspective, consider the analogy of an ocean and the waves that emerge from it.\u00a0 Two neighboring waves in the ocean flow together for some time, and play mirthfully with each other, creating the impression that they have a very deep relationship between them.\u00a0 However, after travelling some distance, one subsides into the ocean, and shortly after, the other does the same.\u00a0 Did they have any relationship between themselves?\u00a0 No, they were both born from the ocean and their relationship was with the ocean itself.\u00a0 Similarly, God is like the ocean and we are like waves who have emanated from Him.\u00a0 We create attachments amongst our bodily relations, only to leave everyone upon death, and journey alone into another birth.\u00a0 The truth is that the souls are not related to each other, but to God, from whom they have all emanated.In this verse, Shree Krishna takes us above bodily consciousness and its concomitant attachment to worldly relatives.\u00a0 From the platform of the soul, God alone is all our relationships; He is our Father, Mother, Sister, Brother, Beloved, and Friend.\u00a0 This theme is reiterated in all the Vedic scriptures:divyo deva eko n\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47o m\u0101t\u0101 pit\u0101 bhr\u0101t\u0101 suh\u1e5bit gati\u1e25\u00a0 niv\u0101sa\u1e25 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 suh\u1e5bit gatirn\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47a iti \u00a0(Sub\u0101l \u015ahruti, mantra 6)\u00a0\u201cLord Narayan alone is the Mother, Father, Beloved, and destination of the soul.\u201dmore sabai eka tumha sw\u0101m\u012b, d\u012bnabhandhu ura antaraj\u0101m\u012b.\u00a0\u00a0 (Ramayan)\u201cO Lord Ram, You alone are my Master, the Savior of the destitute, and the Knower of the heart.\u201d\u00a0 Knowing the magnitude of our eternal relationship with God, we must endeavor to attach our mind to Him alone.\u00a0 Then, the mind will be purified and we will be able to fulfill the condition of m\u0101meka\u1e41 \u015bhara\u1e47a\u1e41 vraja, or complete surrender, which is necessary for receiving God\u2019s grace.\u00a0 To achieve this single-mindedness, we must cut all the present attachments of the mind and replace them with attachment to God.\u00a0 Hence, the Ramayan states:saba kai mamat\u0101 t\u0101ga ba\u1e6dor\u012b, mama pada manahi b\u0101\u00f1dha bari \u1e0dor\u012b.\u201cCut all the strings of worldly attachment of your mind; make a rope of these strings, and tie it at the lotus feet of God.\u201d\u00a0 To help us tie our mind to Him, Shree Krishna here explains to Arjun that the soul\u2019s every relationship is with God alone.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary emphasizes that the soul's true relationship is with God, not with worldly relatives. It explains that attachment to bodily relationships only leads to further bondage in the material illusion. Worldly relationships are temporary and fluctuate based on self-interest, whereas God is the eternal and selfless relative who accompanies us throughout lifetimes. The analogy of waves emerging from the ocean is used to illustrate that our relationships are ultimately with God, from whom we have all emanated. Shree Krishna urges us to shift our focus from bodily consciousness to the soul's relationship with God. By cutting worldly attachments and attaching our mind to God, we can achieve complete surrender and receive God's grace. The commentary concludes by emphasizing that all relationships of the soul are ultimately with God alone.",
