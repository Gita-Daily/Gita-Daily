    "new_commentary": "Devotion to the Supreme Lord has the power to reform even the most fallen souls, as seen in the stories of Ajamil and Valmiki. Valmiki's impious deeds prevented him from chanting the divine Name of Lord Ram, but his Guru devised a method for him to chant the reverse syllables, which eventually transformed into the Lord's name. Through ananya bhakti (exclusive devotion), Valmiki became a legendary saint. This shows that sinners are not condemned forever. Shree Krishna proclaims that even the worst sinners, when they worship God exclusively, should be considered righteous due to their pure intent. The strength of bhakti has the power to transform individuals and elevate them to a higher spiritual plane."
