He is very competent but is definitely not God.\u201d\u00a0 When those under the spell of rajo gu\u1e47a see Him, they say, \u201cThere is nothing special in Him.\u00a0 He is very much like us.\u201d\u00a0 When those dominated by tamo gu\u1e47a see Him, they think, \u201cHe is egotistic and characterless, much worse than us.\u201d\u00a0 It is only the God-realized saints who can recognize Him as God, since they have received divine vision by His grace.\u00a0 And so, Shree Krishna says that the unaware materially conditioned souls do not know Him when He takes an avatar in the world.\n", "next shlok": 12}
