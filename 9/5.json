    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, the concept of Yogmaya \u015bhakti, the divine energy of God, is discussed. Yogmaya is the all-powerful energy of God that can make the impossible possible. It keeps us aloof from perceiving God in our hearts while also keeping Him aloof from the influence of Maya. The Vedas describe Maya as feeling embarrassed to stand before God. Despite the modifications and decay of the world, God remains established in His personality, untouched by it. He is both in the world and beyond it, like ten fingers beyond the material realm. This commentary highlights the mysterious power of Yogmaya and its role in maintaining God's transcendence and the preservation of His nature and personality. ",
