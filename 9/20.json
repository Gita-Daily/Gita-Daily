They perform the ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas.\u00a0 This science of karm k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d (Vedic rituals) is referred to as trai-vidy\u0101.People who are fascinated by the science of trai-vidy\u0101 worship the celestial gods, such as Indra, through the performance of yaj\u00f1as (fire sacrifices) and other rituals.\u00a0 They worship the Supreme Lord indirectly because they do not realize that it is He alone who sanctions the gifts that the celestial gods bestow.\u00a0 Ritualistic ceremonies are considered good deeds, but they are not counted as devotion.\u00a0 The performers of ritualistic ceremonies do not get released from the cycle of life and death.\u00a0 They go to the higher planes of existence within the material universe, such as abode of Indra, the king of heaven.\u00a0 There, they enjoy exquisite celestial delights that are thousands of times more pleasurable than the sensual pleasures available on the earth.\u00a0 In the following verse, Shree Krishna points out the defect in celestial pleasures.\n", "next shlok": 21}
