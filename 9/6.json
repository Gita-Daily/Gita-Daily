    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna has used the term mat sth\u0101ni three times, from the fourth verse to the sixth verse.\u00a0 It means \u201call living beings rest in Him.\u201d\u00a0 They cannot be separated from Him even though they transmigrate in different bodies and accept affinity with matter.\u00a0It may be a little difficult to conceive how the world rests in God.\u00a0 Greek mythology shows a picture of Atlas holding up the globe.\u00a0 In Greek folklore, Atlas fought with the Titans in the war against the deities of Mount Olympus.\u00a0 As punishment, he was condemned to forever bear the earth and the heavens on his back with the great pillar that supposedly separates them on his shoulders.\u00a0 This is not what Shree Krishna means when He says that He is upholding all beings.\u00a0 The entire cosmos exists in space and space is created by God\u2019s energy.\u00a0 Thus, all beings can be said to be resting in Him.\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Lord now gives an analogy to enable Arjun to grasp the concept.\u00a0 The wind has no existence independent from the sky.\u00a0 It moves incessantly and furiously, and yet, it rests within the sky.\u00a0 Likewise, the souls have no existence independent of God.\u00a0 They move in time, place, and consciousness, through transitory bodies, sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly, and yet, they always exist within God.\u00a0From another perspective, everything that exists in cosmos is subordinate to the will of God.\u00a0 It is created, maintained, and annihilated in accordance with His will.\u00a0 In this way also, everything can be said to be resting in Him.\u00a0\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the commentary of these verses, Shree Krishna emphasizes that all living beings rest in Him. He clarifies that they cannot be separated from Him despite transmigrating in different bodies and being bound to matter. To help Arjuna understand, Krishna provides an analogy of the wind resting within the sky, illustrating that souls have no existence independent of God. Furthermore, the entire cosmos exists in space, which is created by God's energy, making all beings rest in Him. From another perspective, everything in the cosmos is subordinate to God's will, as He creates, maintains, and annihilates everything according to His divine plan. Thus, in multiple ways, Krishna highlights that all beings and the entire universe ultimately find their resting place in Him.",
