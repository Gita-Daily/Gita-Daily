    "commentary": "\nS\u0101dhaks (spiritual practitioners) follow different paths of spirituality to reach the Absolute Truth.\u00a0 Shree Krishna previously described those who are devotees.\u00a0 They surrender themselves with devotion at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, in the attitude of being His eternal parts and servants.\u00a0 He now describes some of the other paths that s\u0101dhaks follow.Those who follow the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog consider themselves to be non-different from God.\u00a0 They contemplate deeply on s\u016btras such as:\u00a0 so \u2019ha\u1e41 (I am That), \u015bhivo \u2019ha\u1e41 (I am Shiv), etc.\u00a0 Their ultimate goal is to attain realization of the Supreme Entity as the undifferentiated Brahman, which possesses the attributes of eternality, knowledge, and bliss, but is devoid of forms, qualities, virtues, and pastimes.\u00a0 Shree Krishna says that such j\u00f1\u0101na yogis also worship Him, but in His formless all-pervading aspect.\u00a0 In contrast, there are varieties of a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yogis etc. who see themselves as distinct from God and relate to Him accordingly.Still others worship the manifest universe as God.\u00a0 In Vedic philosophy, this is called vi\u015bhwaroop up\u0101san\u0101 (worship of the cosmic form of God).\u00a0 In western philosophy, it is called \u201cPantheism\u201d from the Greek words pan (all) and theos (God).\u00a0 The most famous exponent of this philosophy has been Spinoza.\u00a0 Since the world is a part of God, keeping a divine sentiment toward it is not wrong, but it is incomplete.\u00a0 Such devotees do not have knowledge of the other aspects of the Supreme Divine Entity, such as Brahman (God\u2019s undifferentiated all-pervading manifestation), Param\u0101tm\u0101 (the Supreme Soul seated in everyone\u2019s hearts), and Bhagav\u0101n (the personal form of God).\u00a0How can all these divergent approaches worship the same God?\u00a0 Shree Krishna answers this in the following verses. \n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary, Shree Krishna discusses different paths followed by spiritual practitioners. He mentions the path of j\u00f1\u0101na-yog, where practitioners believe they are non-different from God and aim to attain realization of the formless Brahman. Shree Krishna explains that these practitioners worship Him in His formless aspect. There are also a\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45g yogis who see themselves as distinct from God. Another path is the worship of the manifest universe as God, known as vi\u015bhwaroop up\u0101san\u0101 or Pantheism. These devotees lack knowledge of other aspects of God. Shree Krishna explains that all these approaches can worship the same God because they are focused on different aspects of the Supreme Divine Entity. This highlights the diverse ways to connect with the Absolute Truth."
