    "commentary": "\nAnger, greed, lust, etc. are considered in the Vedic scriptures as m\u0101nas rog, or diseases of the mind. The Ramayan states: m\u0101nas roga kachhuka mai\u1e45 g\u0101e hahi\u1e45 saba ke\u1e45 lakhi biralenha p\u0101e [v53] We are all aware of the diseases of the body\u2014even a single bodily ailment has the power to make one\u2019s whole day miserable\u2014but we do not realize that we are being continuously tormented by multiple mental ailments. And since we do not recognize lust, anger, greed, etc. as mental diseases, we do not try to cure them. Psychology is a branch of human knowledge that attempts to analyze these ailments and propose solutions to them. However, both the analysis and the solution presented by western psychology leave much to be desired, and appear to be gross approximations of the reality of the mind.In this and the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna has given perfect and penetrating insight into functioning of the mind. He explains that when we repeatedly contemplate that there is happiness in some object, the mind becomes attached to it. For example, in a class there are a number of boys and girls, and they interact innocuously with each other. One day one boy notices something about one girl and starts thinking, \u201cI would be very happy if she were mine.\u201d As he continuously repeats this thought in his mind, his mind becomes attached to her. He tells his friends that he is madly in love with her, and he is unable to study because his mind repeatedly goes to her. His friends ridicule him that they all interact with her in class, but none of them is crazy about her. Why is he losing his sleep and ruining his studies because of her? The fact is that he repeatedly thought that there was happiness in the girl, and so his mind became attached to her.Now attachment seems quite innocuous by itself. But the problem is that from attachment comes desire. If one is attached to drinks, the desire for drinks comes repeatedly to the mind. If one is attached to cigarettes, then thoughts of the pleasure of smoking cigarettes repeatedly flow in the mind, creating a craving for them. In this way, attachment leads to desire.Once desire develops, it gives birth to two more problems\u2014greed and anger. Greed comes from the fulfillment of desire. Jimi pratil\u0101bha lobha adhik\u0101\u012b (Ramayan) [v54] \u201cIf you satisfy desire, it leads to greed.\u201d Thus desire is never eliminated by satiating it:yat p\u1e5bithivy\u0101\u1e41 vr\u012bhi-yava\u1e41 hira\u1e47ya\u1e41 pa\u015bhava\u1e25 striya\u1e25na duhyanti mana\u1e25-pr\u012bti\u1e41 pu\u1e41sa\u1e25 k\u0101ma-hatasya te (Bh\u0101gavatam 9.19.13) [v55]\u201cIf one person were to get all the wealth, luxuries, and sensual objects in the world, that person\u2019s desire would still not be satiated. Hence, knowing it to be the cause of misery, an intelligent person should renounce desire.\u201dOn the flip side what happens if the fulfillment of desire is obstructed? It gives rise to anger. Bear in mind that anger does not arise by itself. It is created from the obstruction of desire; and desire arises from attachment, while attachment comes from contemplation of the sense objects. In this manner, we see how the simple act of contemplating the pleasures of sense objects leads downward to the twin diseases of greed and anger. In the next verse Shree Krishna continues the chain further down, and explains the consequences of anger.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, the author highlights the concept of mental diseases such as anger, greed, and lust. These diseases, referred to as m\u0101nas rog, torment individuals without their awareness. The author criticizes the superficial analysis and solutions proposed by Western psychology in addressing these ailments. Shree Krishna provides insightful understanding of the mind's workings in the verses. He explains how repeated contemplation of happiness in an object leads to attachment. From attachment, desire arises, which then gives birth to greed and anger. The author emphasizes that desire is never fulfilled by satiating it, and an intelligent person should renounce it to avoid misery. Moreover, obstruction of desire results in anger. The chain of contemplation, attachment, desire, and anger demonstrates how the mind continuously moves toward negative emotions. In the subsequent verse, Shree Krishna delves deeper into the consequences of anger."
