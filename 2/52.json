    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains that those attached to worldly pleasures are attracted to flowery Vedic words promoting rituals for material gains. However, those with spiritual knowledge no longer seek such pleasures, knowing their temporary and miserable nature. This understanding leads to disinterest in Vedic rituals. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had states that enlightened sages transcend these rituals, recognizing that the pleasures derived from karmic actions are fleeting and intertwined with suffering."
