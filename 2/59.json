However, even this taste ceases for those who realizes the Supreme.\r\n                        \n", "commentary": "\nWhen one gives up eating, as in a fast, the desires of the senses become feeble. Similarly, in sickness one loses interest toward the objects of enjoyment. These states of dispassion are temporary, for the seed of desire remains within the mind. Again when the fast is terminated or the sickness goes away, the desires return.What is this seed of desire? It is the intrinsic nature of the soul for the divine bliss of God, of whom it is a tiny fragment. Until it gets that divine bliss, the soul can never be contented, and the search for happiness will continue. S\u0101dhaks (spiritual aspirants) may forcibly restrain their senses with their will power, but such restrain is temporary because it does not extinguish the internal flame of desire. However, when the soul engages in devotion toward God, and gets divine bliss, it experiences the higher taste for which it had been craving since infinite lifetimes. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had states:raso vai sa\u1e25 rasa\u1e41 hyev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 \u2019nand\u012b bhavati  (2.7.2)[v50]\u201cGod is all-bliss. When the soul attains God, it becomes satiated in bliss.\u201d Then, one naturally develops dispassion toward the lower sensual pleasures. This detachment that comes through devotion is firm and unshakeable.Thus, the Bhagavad Gita does not teach a dry suppression of desires, instead it teaches the beautiful path of sublimation of desires by directing them toward God. The Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa expressed this principle very eloquently, when he said: \u201cDevotion is love for the highest; and the lowest shall fall away by itself.\u201d\n", "next shlok": 60}
