    "commentary": "\nWhen one gives up eating, as in a fast, the desires of the senses become feeble. Similarly, in sickness one loses interest toward the objects of enjoyment. These states of dispassion are temporary, for the seed of desire remains within the mind. Again when the fast is terminated or the sickness goes away, the desires return.What is this seed of desire? It is the intrinsic nature of the soul for the divine bliss of God, of whom it is a tiny fragment. Until it gets that divine bliss, the soul can never be contented, and the search for happiness will continue. S\u0101dhaks (spiritual aspirants) may forcibly restrain their senses with their will power, but such restrain is temporary because it does not extinguish the internal flame of desire. However, when the soul engages in devotion toward God, and gets divine bliss, it experiences the higher taste for which it had been craving since infinite lifetimes. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had states:raso vai sa\u1e25 rasa\u1e41 hyev\u0101ya\u1e41 labdhv\u0101 \u2019nand\u012b bhavati  (2.7.2)[v50]\u201cGod is all-bliss. When the soul attains God, it becomes satiated in bliss.\u201d Then, one naturally develops dispassion toward the lower sensual pleasures. This detachment that comes through devotion is firm and unshakeable.Thus, the Bhagavad Gita does not teach a dry suppression of desires, instead it teaches the beautiful path of sublimation of desires by directing them toward God. The Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa expressed this principle very eloquently, when he said: \u201cDevotion is love for the highest; and the lowest shall fall away by itself.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary on the Bhagavad Gita explains the temporary nature of dispassion and the underlying seed of desire. When one gives up eating or experiences sickness, the desires of the senses become feeble. However, these states do not permanently extinguish the internal flame of desire. The seed of desire is the soul's intrinsic nature for the divine bliss of God, which can never be contented until it is attained. Spiritual aspirants may restrain their senses temporarily, but true detachment and dispassion come through devotion to God. When the soul engages in devotion and experiences divine bliss, it develops a higher taste that naturally leads to detachment from lower sensual pleasures. The Bhagavad Gita teaches the path of sublimation of desires by directing them towards God, rather than suppressing them. The principle of devotion as expressed by Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa states that love for the highest leads to the falling away of the lowest desires.",
