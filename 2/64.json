    "commentary": "\nThe entire downward spiral leading to ruin begins with contemplating happiness in sense objects. Now, the urge for happiness is as natural to the soul as thirst is to the physical body. It is impossible to think \u201cI will not contemplate happiness anywhere,\u201d because it is unnatural for the soul. The simple solution then is to envision happiness in the proper direction, i.e. in God. If we can repeatedly revise the thought that happiness is in God, we will develop attachment toward him. This divine attachment will not degrade the mind like material attachment; rather, it will purify it. God is all-pure, and when we attach our mind to him, the mind will also become pure.Thus, whenever Shree Krishna asks us to give up attachment and desire, he is referring only to material attachment and desire. Spiritual attachment and desire are not to be given up; in fact, they are most praiseworthy. They are to be cultivated and increased for purification of the mind. The greater the burning desire we develop for God, the purer our mind will become. The j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs who propound the worship of the undifferentiated attributeless Brahman do not understand this point when they recommend giving up all attachments. However, Shree Krishna states: \u201cThose who attach their minds to me with unadulterated devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and attain the level of the supreme Brahman.\u201d (Bhagavad Gita 14.26) He repeatedly urges Arjun to attach his mind to God in many verses ahead, such as 8.7, 8.14, 9.22, 9.34, 10.10, 12.8, 11.54, 18.55, 18.58, 18.65, etc.Attachment and aversion are two sides of the same coin. Aversion is nothing but negative attachment. Just as, in attachment, the object of attachment repeatedly comes to one\u2019s mind; similarly, in aversion, the object of hatred keeps popping into the mind. So attachment and aversion to material objects both have the same effect on the mind\u2014they dirty it and pull it into the three modes of material nature. When the mind is free from both attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in devotion to God, one receives the grace of God and experiences his unlimited divine bliss. On experiencing that higher taste, the mind no longer feels attracted to the sense objects, even while using them. Thus, even while tasting, touching, smelling, hearing, and seeing, like all of us, the sthita praj\u00f1a is free from both attachment and aversion.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the pursuit of happiness is natural to the soul, but it should be directed towards God rather than material objects. By developing attachment towards God, the mind can be purified and elevated. Shree Krishna emphasizes the importance of spiritual attachment and desire, as they lead to the purification of the mind. The worship of the attributeless Brahman, which advocates giving up all attachments, fails to understand this point. Shree Krishna repeatedly urges Arjuna to attach his mind to God in various verses. Attachment and aversion, both being forms of mental attachment, have a negative impact on the mind and bind it to material nature. However, when the mind is free from attachment and aversion and devoted to God, one experiences divine bliss and becomes detached from sense objects even while using them. The sthita praj\u00f1a, or one with a steady intellect, remains free from attachment and aversion in all situations.",
