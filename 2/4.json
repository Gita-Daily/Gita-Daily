    "newest_commentary": "Arjun expresses his confusion and respect for Bheeshma, Dronacharya, and Kripacharya, who he sees as deserving of adoration. Bheeshma was known for his loyalty and remained celibate to fulfill a vow. Dronacharya was a skilled teacher of warfare, and Arjun mastered archery from him. Kripacharya was also highly respected by Arjun. Considering these esteemed individuals as enemies seemed wrong to Arjun, who valued moral duty. He acknowledges his readiness to fight but expresses the need to respect his teachers and show compassion towards Dhritarashtra's sons."
