    "newest_commentary": "Anger impairs judgment and clouds the intellect, leading to regrettable mistakes. When the mind is clouded by anger, one forgets what is right and wrong and becomes swayed by emotions. This descent into confusion and destruction starts with contemplation on sense objects and ends in the ruin of the intellect. The commentary emphasizes the importance of controlling anger and maintaining clarity of thought to avoid making harmful decisions. By understanding the consequences of anger on the intellect, one can strive to rise above negative emotions and cultivate a peaceful and discerning mind."
