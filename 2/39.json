    "commentary": "\nThe word S\u0101nkhya comes from the roots S\u0101\u1e45, meaning \u201ccomplete,\u201d and khy\u0101, meaning \u201cto know.\u201d So S\u0101nkhya means the \u201ccomplete analytical knowledge of something.\u201d The Sankhya Darshan, which is one of the six philosophical treatises in Indian philosophy, makes an analytical enumeration of the entities in cosmos. It lists twenty-four entities: pa\u00f1ch-mah\u0101bh\u016bta (earth, water, fire, air, and sky), pa\u00f1ch tanm\u0101tr\u0101 (the five abstract qualities of matter\u2014taste, touch, smell, sound, and sight), pa\u00f1ch karmendriya (five working senses), pa\u00f1ch j\u00f1\u0101nendriya (five knowledge senses), mind, ahank\u0101r (the entity created by the evolution of mah\u0101n), mah\u0101n (the entity created by evolution of prak\u1e5biti), prak\u1e5biti (the primordial form of the material energy). Apart from these is puru\u1e63h or the soul, which tries to enjoy prak\u1e5biti, and gets bound in it.Shree Krishna has just explained to Arjun another form of S\u0101nkhya, which is the analytical knowledge of the immortal soul. He now says that he is going to reveal the science of working without desire for rewards. This requires detachment from the fruits of actions. Such detachment comes by practicing discrimination with the intellect. Hence, Shree Krishna has interestingly called it buddhi yog, or \u201cYog of the Intellect.\u201d In subsequent verses (2.41 and 2.44), he goes on to explain how the intellect plays an important role in bringing the mind to a state of detachment.\n",
