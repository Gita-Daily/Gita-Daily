For example, let us say that a temple is being built in the holy land of Vrindavan. The workers are engaged in a sacred activity, but their attitude is mundane. They are concerned with the salary they receive. If another contractor offers higher wages, they will not mind switching their job. There is also an ascetic living in Vrindavan, who, seeing the glorious temple being built, engages in k\u0101r sev\u0101 (voluntary work) as a service to God. The external work performed by the sadhu and the workers are the same, but the internal attitudes are poles apart.Here Shree Krishna advises Arjun to move higher in his internal motivation toward work. He declares that those who work with the motivation of self-enjoyment are miserly. Those who are detached from the fruits and dedicate their work to a higher cause are superior. And those who offer the fruits to God are truly in knowledge.The word k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a (miserly) has been used here. The \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam describes a k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a:na veda k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a\u1e25 \u015bhreya \u0101tmano gu\u1e47a-vastu-d\u1e5biktasya t\u0101n ichchhato yachchhed yadi so \u2019pi tath\u0101-vidha\u1e25 (6.9.49)[v42]\u201cK\u1e5bipa\u1e47a are those who think that the ultimate reality consists only of sense objects produced from the material energy.\u201d Again, the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam, states: k\u1e5bipa\u1e47o yo \u2019jitendriya\u1e25 (11.19.44)[v43] \u201cA k\u1e5bipa\u1e47a is one who has no control over the senses.\u201dAs an individual evolves to higher levels of consciousness, one naturally sheds the desire for enjoying the fruits of work, and moves in the direction of service. Bill Gates, having renounced his position in Microsoft Corporation, now dedicates his energy in the service of society. Similarly, after having had his fill of power and position as the President of USA, Bill Clinton now preaches the glories of service to humankind, and has even written a book on the topic, \u201cGiving\u2014How Each Of Us Can Change The World.\u201d Their engagement in service is praiseworthy, but it is still imperfectly oriented. That service attitude becomes perfect when we learn to do our works for the pleasure of God, dedicating all the fruits to him.\n", "next shlok": 50}
