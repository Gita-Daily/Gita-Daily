    "commentary": "\nThe illusion of death is created because we identify ourselves with the body. The Ramayan explains this as follows:jau\u1e45 sapane\u1e45 sira k\u0101\u1e6dai ko\u012b, binu j\u0101ge\u1e45 na d\u016bri dukh ho\u012b. [v23]\u201cIf we dream of our head getting cut, we will perceive its pain until we wake up.\u201d The incident in the dream is an illusion, but the experience of the pain continues to torment until we wake up and dispel the illusion. Similarly, in the illusion that we are the body, we fear the experience of death. For the enlightened soul whose illusion has been dispelled, this fear of death vanishes.One may ask that if nobody can kill anyone, then why is murder considered a punishable offense? The answer is that the body is the vehicle of the soul, and destroying any living being\u2019s vehicle is violence, which is forbidden. The Vedas clearly instruct: m\u0101 hinsy\u0101t sarvabh\u016bt\u0101ni [v24] \u201cDo not commit violence toward anyone.\u201d In fact, the Vedas even consider killing of animals as a crime. However, there are occasions where the rules change and even violence becomes necessary. For example, in cases where a snake is approaching to bite, or if one is attacked with lethal weapons, or one\u2019s life sustenance is being snatched away, then violence is permitted for self-protection. In the present situation, what is appropriate for Arjun, violence or non-violence, and why? Shree Krishna will explain this to him in great detail, as the dialogue of the Bhagavad Gita progresses. And in the course of the explanation, priceless divine knowledge will be revealed to shed light on the subject.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that the illusion of death arises due to our identification with the body. Just like in a dream where the pain continues until we wake up, the fear of death persists as long as we believe we are the body. However, for an enlightened soul, this fear vanishes as the illusion is dispelled. While it may seem that nobody can kill anyone, the Vedas teach that violence should not be committed towards any living being. Killing animals is also considered a crime. However, there are exceptions where self-defense permits violence, such as when one's life is in immediate danger. Shree Krishna will later explain to Arjun whether violence or non-violence is appropriate in their current situation. This dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita will reveal valuable divine knowledge.",
    "newest_commentary": "The commentary discusses the illusion of death caused by our identification with the body. The fear of death persists as long as we believe we are the body, but an enlightened soul overcomes this fear. Violence towards any living being is prohibited, including killing animals. Self-defense may be an exception. Shree Krishna will later provide guidance on violence and non-violence in their situation. This dialogue in the Bhagavad Gita shares divine knowledge."
