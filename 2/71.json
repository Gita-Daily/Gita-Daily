    "commentary": "\nIn this verse, Shree Krishna lists the things that disturb one\u2019s peace, and then asks Arjun to give them up.Material desires. The moment we harbor a desire, we walk into the trap of greed and anger. Either way, we get trapped. So the path to inner peace does not lie in fulfilling desires, but instead in eliminating them.Greed. Firstly, greed for material advancement is a great waste of time. Secondly, it is an endless chase. In developed countries, very few people are deprived of enough to eat and wear, and yet they remain disturbed; this is because their hankering is still unsatisfied. Thus, those who possess the wealth of contentment possess one of the biggest treasures of life.Ego. Most of the quarrels that erupt between people stem from the ego. Mark H McCormack, author of What They Don\u2019t Teach You At Harvard Business School writes: \u201cMost corporate executives are one giant ego, with a couple of arms and legs sticking out.\u201d Statistics reveal that a majority of executives, who lose their jobs in the senior management level, do so not because of professional incompetence, but because of interpersonal issues. The way to peace is not to nurture and increase pride, but to get rid of it.Proprietorship. The feeling of proprietorship is based upon ignorance because the whole world belongs to God. We came empty-handed in the world, and we will go back empty-handed. How then can we think of worldly things as ours?\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this verse, Shree Krishna discusses the factors that disturb one's inner peace and advises Arjuna to let go of them. Material desires lead to greed and anger, trapping individuals in an endless cycle. Fulfilling these desires does not bring inner peace; instead, eliminating them does. Greed for material advancement is both a waste of time and an insatiable pursuit. Contentment is a valuable treasure that surpasses material wealth. Ego is often the root cause of conflicts among people, including corporate executives. Interpersonal issues, stemming from excessive pride, lead to job losses in senior management positions. To attain peace, one must eliminate pride. The feeling of proprietorship is based on ignorance as everything in the world belongs to God. We enter and leave the world with nothing, so considering worldly possessions as our own is misguided."
