    "commentary": "\nAs s\u0101dhaks advance on the spiritual path, within their minds their relationship with God becomes stronger. At that time, they find the Vedic rituals they were previously performing to be cumbersome and time consuming. They then wonder whether they are obliged to keep performing the rituals, along with their devotion, and if they reject the ritual and dedicate themselves fully to their s\u0101dhan\u0101, will they be committing an offense? Such people will find the answer to their doubt in this verse. Shree Krishna says that to be fixed in s\u0101dhan\u0101 without being allured to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offence; rather, it is a higher spiritual state.Madhavendra Puri, the famous 14th century sage, states this sentiment very emphatically. He was a Vedic Brahmin and used to engage in extensive ritualistic practices, but then took to sany\u0101s (the renounced order), and engaged wholeheartedly in devotion to Shree Krishna. In his later life, he wrote:sandhy\u0101 vandana bhadramastu bhavate bho\u1e25 sn\u0101na tubhya\u1e41 nama\u1e25bho dev\u0101\u1e25 pitara\u015bhchatarapa\u1e47a vidhau naha\u1e41 k\u1e63hama\u1e25 k\u1e63hamyat\u0101myatra kv\u0101pi ni\u1e63hadya y\u0101dava kulottaasya kansadvi\u1e63ha\u1e25sm\u0101ra\u1e41 sm\u0101ramagha\u1e41 har\u0101mi tadala\u1e41 manye kimanyena me [v46]\u201cI wish to apologize to all kinds of rituals as I have no time to respect them. So dear Sandhy\u0101 Vandan (a set of rituals performed thrice daily by those who have received the sacred thread), holy baths, sacrifices to the celestial gods, offerings to the ancestors, etc. please excuse me. Now, wherever I sit, I remember the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna, the enemy of Kansa, and that is sufficient to release me from material bondage.\u201dShree Krishna uses the word sam\u0101dh\u0101v-achal\u0101 in this verse, to refer to the state of steadfastness in divine consciousness. The word Sam\u0101dhi has been formed from the roots sam (equilibrium) and dhi (intellect), meaning, \u201ca state of total equilibrium of the intellect.\u201d One who is steadfast in the higher consciousness, unmoved by material allurements attains that state of Sam\u0101dhi, or perfect Yog.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary explains that as spiritual practitioners progress, they may find Vedic rituals burdensome and wonder if they are obligated to continue them. Shree Krishna assures them that being dedicated to their spiritual practice without being attached to the fruitive sections of the Vedas is not an offense but a higher spiritual state. Madhavendra Puri, a sage from the 14th century, exemplifies this by transitioning from Vedic rituals to full devotion to Shree Krishna. In his later life, he expressed his apology to rituals, as he focused solely on remembering Shree Krishna. The verse highlights the importance of steadfastness in divine consciousness, equating it to Sam\u0101dhi, a state of total equilibrium of the intellect where one remains unaffected by material allurements and attains perfect Yog.",
