The soul, being divine and beyond the realm of material energy, is invisible to our eyes. Scientists have conducted experiments to perceive its presence. They put a dying person into a glass case and sealed the case, to see whether the departure of the soul would crack the glass. However, the soul left the body without the glass box getting cracked. Being subtle, the soul did not need physical space for its movement.Being subtler than the material energy, the soul is also inconceivable to our intellect. The Ka\u1e6dhopani\u1e63had says:indriyebhya\u1e25 par\u0101 hyarth\u0101 arthebhya\u015bhcha para\u1e41 mana\u1e25manasastu par\u0101 buddhirbhuddher\u0101tm\u0101 mah\u0101n para\u1e25 (1.3.10) [v29]\u201cBeyond the senses are the objects of the senses; subtler than the objects of the senses is the mind. Beyond the mind is the intellect; and subtler than the intellect is the soul.\u201d The material intellect can only comprehend material concepts, but can never reach the divine soul by the power of its contemplation. As a result, knowledge of the self requires external sources, which are the scriptures and the Guru.\n", "next shlok": 26}
