    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna uses the word atha to indicate that Arjun may want to believe the other explanations that exist about the nature of the self. This verse needs to be understood in the context of the philosophical streams existing in India and their divergent understandings about the nature of self. Indian philosophy has historically comprised of twelve schools of thought. Six of these accept the authority of the Vedas, and hence they are called \u0100stik Dar\u015bhans. These are M\u012bm\u0101ns\u0101, Ved\u0101nt, Ny\u0101ya, Vai\u015bhe\u1e63hik, S\u0101nkhya, and Yog. Within each of these are more branches\u2014for example, the Ved\u0101nt school of thought is further divided into six schools\u2014Adavita v\u0101da, Dwaita v\u0101da, Vi\u015bhi\u1e63h\u1e6d\u0101dvaita v\u0101da, Vi\u015bhuddhadvaita v\u0101da, Dwait\u0101dvaita v\u0101da, and Achintya-bhed\u0101bheda v\u0101da. Each of these has further branches, for example, Advaita v\u0101da is subdivided into D\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di-s\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e6di v\u0101da, Avachchheda v\u0101da, Bimba-pratibimba v\u0101da, Vivarta v\u0101da, Aj\u0101ta v\u0101da, etc. We will not go into the details of these schools here. Let it suffice for now to know that all these schools of thought accept the Vedas as the authority of reference. Accordingly, they all accept the eternal, unchangeable soul as the self.The remaining six schools of Indian philosophy do not accept the authority of the Vedas. These are Ch\u0101rv\u0101k v\u0101da, the four Buddhist schools (Yog\u0101ch\u0101r v\u0101da, M\u0101dhyamik v\u0101da, Vaibh\u0101\u015bhik v\u0101da, and Saut\u0101ntrik v\u0101da), and Jainism. Each of these has its own explanation for the nature of the self. Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka v\u0101da states that the body itself comprises the self, and consciousness is merely a product of the conglomeration of its constituents. Jainism states that the soul is the same size as the body, and hence, it is subject to change from birth to birth. The Buddhist schools of thought do not accept the existence of a permanent soul, and instead maintain that there is a stream of renewed animation from lifetime to lifetime, which ensures continuity of the individual.It seems that at the time of Shree Krishna too, versions of the Buddhist philosophy of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul existed. Hence he is explaining that even if Arjun subscribes to this philosophy of renewed animation of the self from life to life, there is still no reason to lament. Why should one not lament? This is now explained in the next verse.\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary explores the different philosophical schools in ancient India and their beliefs about the nature of the self. It mentions the six \u0100stik Dar\u015bhans, which accept the authority of the Vedas and believe in the existence of the eternal, unchangeable soul. The remaining six schools, including Ch\u0101rv\u0101ka, Buddhism, and Jainism, do not accept the Vedas and have their own explanations for the nature of the self. The commentary suggests that at the time of Shree Krishna, there were versions of Buddhist philosophy that believed in the concept of renewed animation and non-permanence of the soul. However, Krishna explains to Arjun that even if he subscribes to this philosophy, there is no reason to lament. The reason for this will be explained in the next verse.",
