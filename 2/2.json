    "new_commentary": "According to the Manu Smriti, an Aryan refers to a highly evolved and cultured individual, not a race or ethnic group. The Vedic scriptures aim to guide humans to become Aryans in all aspects. Krishna reprimands Arjuna for his confusion in living up to this ideal state. The Bhagavad Gita begins as Krishna starts speaking, inducing in Arjuna a hunger for knowledge. Krishna points out that confusion is dishonorable and reminds Arjuna of the consequences of delusion. Krishna intentionally makes Arjuna uncomfortable to motivate him to seek true knowledge. The resolution of doubt leads to a deeper understanding. Through turmoil and doubt, individuals can reach a higher level of understanding.",
    "newest_commentary": "The Bhagavad Gita emphasizes that being an Aryan means being highly evolved and cultured, not belonging to a specific race or ethnicity. Krishna criticizes Arjuna for his confusion about living up to this ideal state. As Krishna begins speaking, Arjuna develops a thirst for knowledge. Krishna highlights that confusion is dishonorable and warns Arjuna about the consequences of delusion. Krishna deliberately makes Arjuna uncomfortable to encourage him to seek true knowledge. Resolving doubts leads to a deeper comprehension. Through turmoil and doubt, individuals can attain a higher level of understanding."
