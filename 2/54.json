    "commentary": "\nThe designations sthita praj\u00f1a (one with steady intellect) and sam\u0101dhi-stha (situated in trance) apply to enlightened persons. Having heard from Shree Krishna about the state of perfect yog, or Sam\u0101dhi, Arjun asks a natural question. He wishes to know the nature of the mind of a person who is in this state. Additionally he wishes to know how this divine state of mind manifests in a person\u2019s behavior.Beginning with this verse, Arjun asks Shree Krishna sixteen sets of questions. In response, Shree Krishna reveals the deepest secrets of karm yog, j\u00f1\u0101na yog, bhakti yog, austerity, meditation, etc. The sixteen sets of questions asked by Arjun are:1. \u201cWhat is the disposition of one who is situated in divine consciousness? (verse 2.54)2. \u201cIf you consider knowledge superior to fruitive works, then why do you ask me to wage this terrible war?\u201d (verse 3.1)3. \u201cWhy is a person impelled to commit sinful acts, even unwillingly, as if by force?\u201d (verse 3.36)4. \u201cYou were born much after Vivasvan. How am I to understand that in the beginning you instructed this science to him?\u201d (verse 4.4)5. \u201cYou praised the path of renunciation of actions, and again you praised work with devotion. Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?\u201d (verse 5.1)6. \u201cO Krishna, the mind is very restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate. It appears to me that it is more difficult to control than the wind.\u201d (verse 6.34)7. \u201cWhat is the fate of the unsuccessful yogi who begins the path with faith, but whose mind deviates from God due to untamed passions, and is unable to reach the highest perfection in this life?\u201d (verse 6.37)8. \u201cWhat is Brahman and what is karma? What is Adhibh\u016bta, and who are the \u0100dhidaiva? Who is \u0100dhiyaj\u00f1a and how does he dwell in this body? O slayer of the Madhu demon, how can those of steadfast mind be united with you at the time of death?\u201d (verse 8.1-2)9. \u201cPlease describe to me your divine opulences, by which you pervade all the worlds.\u201d (verse 10.16)10. \u201cI long to see your cosmic form, O Supreme divine Personality.\u201d (verse 11.3)11. \u201cYou, who existed before all creation, I wish to know who you are, for your nature and workings mystify me.\u201d (verse 11.31)12. \u201cBetween those who are steadfastly devoted to your personal form and those who worship the formless Brahman, whom do you consider to be more perfect in Yog?\u201d (verse 12.1)13. \u201cI wish to know about Prak\u1e5biti (Nature) and Puru\u015bh (the enjoyer). What is the field of activities, and who is the knower of the field? What is the nature of knowledge, and the object of knowledge?\u201d (verse 13.1)14. \u201cWhat are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three gu\u1e47as, O Lord? How do they act? How have they passed beyond the bondage of the gu\u1e47as?\u201d (verse 14.21)15. \u201cWhere do they stand who disregard the injunctions of the scriptures, but still worship with faith?\u201d (verse 17.1)16. \u201cI wish to understand the nature of sany\u0101s (renunciation), and how it is distinct from ty\u0101g, or renouncing the fruits of actions.\u201d (verse 18.1)\n",
