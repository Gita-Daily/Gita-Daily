    "commentary": "\nThis is a great moment in the Bhagavad Gita, when for the first time Arjun, who is Shree Krishna\u2019s friend and cousin, requests him to be his Guru. Arjun pleads to Shree Krishna that he has been overpowered by k\u0101rpa\u1e47ya do\u1e63h, or the flaw of cowardice in behavior, and so he requests the Lord to become his Guru and instruct him about the path of auspiciousness.All the Vedic scriptures declare in unison that it is through the medium of a Spiritual Master that we receive divine knowledge for our eternal welfare:tadvij\u00f1\u0101n\u0101rtha\u1e41 sagurumev\u0101bhigachchhet samitp\u0101ni\u1e25 \u015bhrotriya\u1e41 bhramhani\u1e63h\u1e6dham (Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had 1.2.12) [v4]\u201cTo know the Absolute Truth, approach a Guru who is both a knower of the scriptures and is practically situated on the platform of God-realization.\u201dtasm\u0101d guru\u1e41 prapadyeta jij\u00f1\u0101su\u1e25 \u015bhreya uttamam\u015bh\u0101bde pare cha ni\u1e63h\u1e47\u0101ta\u1e41 brahma\u1e47y upa\u015bham\u0101\u015bhrayam(Bh\u0101gavatam 11.3.21) [v5]\u201cSeekers of the Truth should surrender themselves to a Spiritual Master who has understood the conclusion of the scriptures and taken complete shelter of God, leaving aside all material considerations.\u201dThe Ramayan states:guru binu bhava nidhi tarai na ko\u012b, jau\u1e45 biranchi sankara sama ho\u012b. [v6]\u201cNot even the most elevated of spiritual aspirants can cross over the material ocean without the grace of the Guru.\u201d Shree Krishna states this himself in the Bhagavad Gita in verse 4.34: \u201cLearn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.\u201dTo demonstrate the need for accepting a Guru to gain knowledge, Shree Krishna himself took this step. In his youth, he went to the hermitage of Sandipani Muni to learn sixty-four sciences from him. His classmate, Sudama, remarked regarding this:yasya chchhando maya\u1e41 brahma deha \u0101vapana\u1e41 vibho\u015bhreyas\u0101\u1e41 tasya guru\u1e63hu v\u0101so \u2019tyanta vi\u1e0dambanam(Bh\u0101gavatam 10.80.45) [v7]\u201cO Shree Krishna, the Vedas are like your body, manifested from the knowledge that you possess (hence, what requirement do you have for making a Guru). Yet, you too pretend you need to learn from a Guru; this is only your divine leela (pastime).\u201d Shree Krishna is in fact the first Guru of the world, because he is the Guru of Brahma, the first-born in this material world. He performed this leela for our benefit, to teach by his example that we souls, who are under the influence of Maya, will need a Guru to dispel our ignorance. In this verse, Arjun takes the step of surrendering to Shree Krishna as his disciple, and requests his Guru to enlighten him regarding the proper course of action.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this moment in the Bhagavad Gita, Arjun seeks guidance from Shree Krishna, his friend and cousin, as he feels overwhelmed by cowardice. Arjun acknowledges the importance of a spiritual master, who imparts divine knowledge for eternal welfare. The scriptures emphasize surrendering to a guru who understands the scriptures and is devoted to God. Even the most elevated spiritual aspirants cannot cross the material ocean without the guru's grace. Shree Krishna himself demonstrates the need for a guru by seeking knowledge from Sandipani Muni. Though Shree Krishna possesses infinite knowledge, he exemplifies the significance of a guru. Shree Krishna, as the Guru of Brahma, sets the example for souls influenced by Maya to seek a guru. In this verse, Arjun surrenders to Shree Krishna as his disciple and requests guidance on the right path."
