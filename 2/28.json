    "commentary": "\nShree Krishna dispelled the cause of lamentation in respect to the soul in verse 2.20, and in respect to the body in verse 2.27. Now he includes both in this verse. Sage Narad instructed Yudhishthir along similar lines, in \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam:yan manyase dhruva\u1e41 lokam adhruva\u1e41 v\u0101 na chobhayamsarvath\u0101 na hi \u015bhochy\u0101s te sneh\u0101d anyatra mohaj\u0101t (1.13.44) [v31]\u201cWhether you consider the personality to be an eternal soul or to be a temporary body, or even if you accept it as an inconceivable mixture of soul and body, you should not lament in any way. The cause for lamentation is only attachment that arises out of illusion.\u201dIn the material realm, each individual soul is bound by three bodies\u2014gross body, subtle body, causal body.Gross body: Consists of the five gross elements of nature\u2014earth, water, fire, air, and space.Subtle body: Consists of eighteen elements\u2014five life-airs, five working senses, five knowledge senses, mind, intellect, and ego.Causal body: Consists of the account of karmas from endless past lives, including the sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) carried forward from previous lives.At the time of death, the soul discards its gross body, and departs with the subtle and causal bodies. God again gives the soul another gross body according to its subtle and causal bodies, and sends the soul into a suitable mother\u2019s womb for the purpose. After the soul gives up one gross body, there is a transitional phase before it receives a new gross body. This could be a few seconds in duration or a few years long. So before birth, the soul existed with the unmanifest subtle and causal bodies. After death, it still exists in the unmanifest state. It only becomes manifest in the middle. So death is no reason for grief.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna addresses the cause of lamentation related to the soul and the body. He emphasizes that attachment is the root of sorrow, regardless of whether one sees the personality as an eternal soul, a temporary body, or a combination of both. The material realm consists of three bodies: the gross body made of elements, the subtle body composed of life-airs, senses, mind, intellect, and ego, and the causal body containing karmic imprints from past lives. At the time of death, the soul sheds its gross body but retains the subtle and causal bodies. God then provides a new gross body based on these bodies and places the soul in a suitable womb. There is a transitional phase before receiving a new body. Thus, the soul exists in the unmanifest state before birth and after death, with manifestation occurring in between. This understanding allows us to overcome grief associated with death.",
