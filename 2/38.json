    "commentary": "\nHaving motivated Arjun from the mundane level, Shree Krishna now moves deeper into the science of work. Arjun had expressed his fear that by killing his enemies he would incur sin. Shree Krishna addresses this apprehension. He advises Arjun to do his duty, without attachment to the fruits of his actions. Such an attitude to work will release him from any sinful reactions.When we work with selfish motives, we create karmas, which bring about their subsequent karmic reactions. The M\u0101\u1e6dhar \u015ahruti states:pu\u1e47yena pu\u1e47ya loka\u1e41 nayati p\u0101pena p\u0101pamubh\u0101bhy\u0101meva manu\u1e63hyalokam [v34]\u201cIf you do good deeds, you will go to the celestial abodes; if you do bad deeds, you will go to the nether regions; if you do a mixture of both, you will come back to the planet Earth.\u201d In either case, we get bound by the reactions of our karmas. Thus, mundane good deeds are also binding. They result in material rewards, which add to the stockpile of our karmas and thicken the illusion that there is happiness in the world.However, if we give up selfish motives, then our actions no longer create any karmic reactions. For example, murder is a sin, and the judicial law of every country of the world declares it to be a punishable offence. But if a policeman in the discharge of his duty kills the leader of a gang of bandits, he is not punished for it. If a soldier kills an enemy soldier in battle, he is not punished for it. In fact, he can even be awarded a medal for bravery. The reason for apparent lack of punishment is that these actions are not motivated by any ill-will or personal motive; they are performed as a matter of duty to the country. God\u2019s law is quite similar. If one gives up all selfish motives and works merely for the sake of duty toward the Supreme, such work does not create any karmic reactions.So Shree Krishna advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and simply focus on doing his duty. When he fights with the attitude of equanimity, treating victory and defeat, pleasure and pain as the same, then despite killing his enemies, he will never incur sin. This subject is also repeated later in the Bhagavad Gita, in verse 5.10: \u201cJust as a lotus leaf is untouched by water, those who dedicate all their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin.\u201dHaving declared a profound conclusion about work without attachment, Shree Krishna now says that he will explain the science of work in detail, to reveal the logic behind what he has said.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary of the Bhagavad Gita, Shree Krishna addresses Arjun's fear of incurring sin by killing his enemies. He advises Arjun to perform his duty without attachment to the outcomes, which will release him from any sinful reactions. When we work with selfish motives, we create karmas that bind us to the reactions of our actions. Mundane good deeds may bring material rewards but still bind us. However, if we give up selfish motives, our actions no longer create karmic reactions. Shree Krishna compares this to the actions of a policeman killing a gang leader or a soldier killing an enemy in battle, where there is no punishment due to the absence of ill-will or personal motive. He advises Arjun to become detached from outcomes and focus on doing his duty with equanimity. By dedicating all actions to God and abandoning attachment, one remains untouched by sin. Shree Krishna promises to explain the science of work in detail to reveal the logic behind this advice."
