Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in Truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe material energy binds the divine soul to the bodily conception of life, by its three constituent modes. These modes of material nature are sattva (mode of goodness), rajas (mode of passion), and tamas (mode of ignorance). The relative proportion of the three modes varies for every individual, due their sansk\u0101rs (tendencies) from countless past lives, and accordingly, everyone has different inclinations and tendencies. The Vedic scriptures accept this disparity and give suitable instructions for all kinds of people. If the \u015bh\u0101stras did not contain instructions for worldly-minded people, they would have gone further astray. So, the Vedas offer them material rewards for the performance of rigorous rituals, helping them rise from the mode of ignorance to passion, and from passion to goodness.Thus, the Vedas contain both kinds of knowledge\u2014ritualistic ceremonies for the materially attached and divine knowledge for spiritual aspirants. When Shree Krishna tells Arjun to reject the Vedas, the statement needs to be understood in the context of the preceding and following verses. He is implying that Arjun should not be attracted by the section of the Vedas that propounds rules, regulations, and ceremonies for material rewards. Instead, he should use the divine section of the Vedic knowledge to elevate himself to the level of Absolute Truth.\n",

Each individual has different inclinations and tendencies based on their past lives. The Vedas accommodate the diversity and offer instructions for both worldly-minded individuals and spiritual aspirants. The Vedic scriptures contain rituals and ceremonies for material rewards, helping people progress from ignorance to passion, and from passion to goodness. However, Shree Krishna advises Arjun to not be attracted to the section of the Vedas that focuses on material rewards. Instead, he should seek the divine knowledge that leads to the Absolute Truth. Krishna's statement is contextual and urges Arjun to elevate himself spiritually using the higher wisdom in the Vedas.",
