Psychologists categorize the fear of death as the biggest fear in life. In Patanjali\u2019s Yog Dar\u015bhan too, abhinive\u015bh, or the instinctive urge to survive at all costs, is mentioned as a trait of the material intellect. But for one who has taken birth, death is inevitable. So when something is inevitable, why lament over it?The Mahabharat relates an incident regarding this. During the period of their exile in the forest, one day while wandering the five Pandavas were thirsty and came across a well. Yudhishthir asked Bheem to go and fetch water for all of them. When Bheem reached the well, a yak\u1e63ha (semi-celestial being) began speaking from inside the well, \u201cI will only let you take the water if you first answer my questions.\u201d Bheem paid no heed and proceeded to draw water. The yak\u1e63ha pulled him in. After some time when Bheem did not return, a concerned Yudhishthir sent Arjun to see what was happening and fetch water. When Arjun reached the well, the yak\u1e63ha asked him too, \u201cI have already seized your brother. Do not attempt to draw the water unless you can answer all my questions correctly.\u201d Arjun also paid no heed, and the yak\u1e63ha pulled him into the well. The other brothers, Nakul and Sahadev, followed him, but met with the same fate. Finally, Yudhishthir himself came to the well. Once again, the yak\u1e63ha said, \u201cAnswer my questions if you want to drink water from the well, or I will pull you in, just as I have done to your four brothers.\u201d Yudhisthir agreed to answer the questions. The yak\u1e63ha was actually the celestial God of death, Yamraj, in disguise. He asked sixty questions, each of which was answered perfectly by Yudhishthir. One of these questions was: kim \u0101\u015bhcharya\u1e41? \u201cWhat is the most surprising thing in this world?\u201d Yudhisthir replied:ahany ahani bh\u016bt\u0101ni gachchhant\u012bha yam\u0101layam\u015bhe\u1e63h\u0101\u1e25 sthiratvam ichchhanti kim\u0101\u015bhcharyamata\u1e25 param (Mahabharat) [v30]\u201cAt every moment people are dying. Those who are alive are witnessing this phenomenon, and yet they do not think that one day they will also have to die. What can be more astonishing than this?\u201d Shree Krishna explains in this verse that life is inescapably a dead end, and so a wise person does not lament over the inevitable.\n", "next shlok": 28}
