The paradox of life is that we strive for happiness, but reap misery; we crave love, but we meet with disappointment; we covet life, but know we are moving toward death at every moment. The Bh\u0101gavatam states:sukh\u0101ya karm\u0101\u1e47i karoti loko na tai\u1e25 sukha\u1e41 v\u0101nyad-up\u0101rama\u1e41 v\u0101vindeta bh\u016byas tata eva du\u1e25kha\u1e41 yad atra yukta\u1e41 bhagav\u0101n vaden na\u1e25 (3.5.2)[v44]\u201cEvery human being engages in fruitive works to get happiness, but finds no satisfaction. Instead, these activities only aggravate the misery.\u201d As a result, practically everyone in this world is unhappy. Some suffer from the miseries of their own body and mind; others are tormented by their family members and relatives; some suffer from scarcity of wealth and the paucity of the necessities of life. Materially minded people know they are unhappy, but they think that others ahead of them must be happy, and so they continue running in the direction of material growth. This blind pursuit has been going on for many lifetimes and yet there is no sight of happiness. Now, if people could realize that nobody has ever achieved happiness by engaging in fruitive works, they would then understand that the direction in which they are running is futile, and they would think of doing a U-turn toward spiritual life.Those whose intellects have become steadfast with spiritual knowledge understand that God is the Supreme Enjoyer of everything. Consequently, they renounce attachment to the fruits of their actions, offer everything to him, and serenely accept everything that comes as his pras\u0101d (mercy). In doing so, their actions become free from karmic reactions that bind one to the cycle of life and death.\n", "next shlok": 52}
