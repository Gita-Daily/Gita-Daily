    "translation": "\n\nBG 2.24:\r\n                            The soul is unbreakable and incombustible; it can neither be dampened nor dried. It is everlasting, in all places, unalterable, immutable, and primordial.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nThe point about immortality is again being driven home here. For the teacher to merely impart perfect knowledge is not enough; for that knowledge to be useful, it must sink deep into the heart of the student. Hence a skillful teacher often repeats a point previously made. In Sanskrit literature, this is called punarukti, or “repetition.” Shree Krishna has often used punarukti, as a tool in the Bhagavad Gita for stressing the important spiritual principles to ensure that they are grasped deeply by his student.\n",
