But with his determination, Arjun had disciplined himself in such a way that sleep would come to him only when he permitted it, and only for the amount of time he chose. By using the name Gu\u1e0d\u0101ke\u015bh for Arjun, Sanjay is subtly hinting to Dhritarasthra, \u201cJust as this \u201chero amongst men\u201d conquered sleep, so too will he conquer his despondency.\u201dAnd the word he uses for Shree Krishna is H\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u012bke\u015bh, or \u201cmaster of the mind and senses.\u201d The subtle hint here is that he who is the master of his senses will definitely ensure that the events are properly managed.\n", "next shlok": 10}
