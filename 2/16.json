    "commentary": "\nAccording to the \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had, there are three entities in existence:bhokt\u0101 bhogya\u1e41 prerit\u0101ra\u1e41 cha matv\u0101 sarva\u1e41 prokta\u1e41 trividha\u1e41 brahmametat (1.12) [v13]k\u1e63hara\u1e41 pradh\u0101namam\u1e5bit\u0101k\u1e63hara\u1e41 hara\u1e25 k\u1e63har\u0101tm\u0101n\u0101v\u012b\u015bhate deva eka\u1e25 (1.10) [v14]sanyuktametatk\u1e63haramak\u1e63hara\u1e41 cha vyakt\u0101vyakta\u1e41 bharate vi\u015bhvam\u012b\u015bha\u1e25 (1.8) [v15]All these Ved mantras state that these three entities\u2014God, the individual soul, and Maya\u2014are all eternal.1. God is everlasting. Thus he is sat (eternally existing). Hence, a name for him in the Vedas is sat-chit-\u0101nand (eternal-full of knowledge-ocean of bliss).2. The soul is imperishable, and hence it is sat. However, the body will cease to exist one day, and hence it is asat (temporary). The soul is also sat-chit-\u0101nand, but it is also a\u1e47u (tiny). Hence the soul is a\u1e47u sat, a\u1e47u chit, and a\u1e47u \u0101nand.3. The entity Maya from which the world has been made is eternal, or sat. However, all material objects we see around us came into existence and will be destroyed with time. Thus, they can all be termed as asat, or temporary. So while the world itself is asat, it is only the entity Maya that is sat.When we say that the world is asat, this should not be confused with mithy\u0101. Asat (temporary) does not mean mithy\u0101 (non-existent). Some philosophers claim that the world is mithy\u0101, or \u201cnon-existent.\u201d They assert that it is only the ignorance within us that is making us perceive the world, and once we are situated in brahma-j\u00f1\u0101na (knowledge of the Supreme) the world will cease to exist. However, if this were true, then the world should no longer have remained for the God-realized Saints. Since they had destroyed their ignorance, the world should have stopped existing for them. Why then did these Saints write books even after attaining the state of God-realization? Where did the paper and pen come from? The fact that brahma-j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs use the objects of the world proves that the world exists even for them. Besides, even brahma-j\u00f1\u0101n\u012bs need food to nourish their bodies. The Vedic scriptures state: pa\u015bhv\u0101dibhi\u015bhch\u0101vi\u015bhe\u1e63hat [v16] \u201cEven God-realized Saints feels hungry, just as animals do, and need to eat food.\u201d If the world does not exist for them, then how and why should they eat?Further, the Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had repeatedly informs us that God is all-pervading in the world:so \u2019k\u0101mayata bahu sy\u0101\u1e41 praj\u0101yeyeti sa tapo \u2019tapyata sa tapastaptv\u0101 ida\u1e41sarvamas\u1e5bijata yadida\u1e41 ki\u1e41 cha tats\u1e5bi\u1e63htv\u0101 tadev\u0101nupr\u0101vi\u1e63hat tadanupravi\u015bhya sachcha tyachch\u0101bhavat nirukta\u1e41 ch\u0101nirukta\u1e41 cha nilayana\u1e41 ch\u0101nilayna\u1e41 cha vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 ch\u0101vij\u00f1\u0101na\u1e41 cha satya\u1e41 ch\u0101n\u1e5bitam cha satyamabhavat yadida\u1e41 ki\u1e41 cha tatsatyamity\u0101chak\u1e63hate tadapye\u1e63ha \u015bhloko bhavati (2.6.4) [v17]This Vedic mantra states that God not only created the world, but also permeates every atom of it. If God is truly all-pervading in this world, then how can the world have no existence? To say that the world is mithy\u0101 is to contradict the fact that God pervades the world. In this verse, Shree Krishna explains that the world does exist, but it is fleeting. Thus, he calls it as asat, or \u201ctemporary.\u201d He does not call it mithy\u0101, or \u201cnon-existent.\u201d\n",

    "new_commentary": "According to the commentary, the \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had explains the existence of three eternal entities: God, the individual soul, and Maya. God is everlasting, the soul is imperishable but the body is temporary, and Maya is the entity from which the world is made. The world itself is temporary, but it is not non-existent. The belief that the world is mithy\u0101 or non-existent is refuted by the fact that even the God-realized Saints perceive and interact with the world. The Taittir\u012bya Upani\u1e63had emphasizes that God not only created the world but also permeates every atom of it. Thus, the world exists but is fleeting or temporary (asat), not non-existent (mithy\u0101). Shree Krishna explains in the Bhagavad Gita that the world is temporary but not non-existent.",
