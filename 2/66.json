    "commentary": "\nThis verse strengthens the conclusion of the previous verse by stating the reverse and negating it. Previously, Shree Krishna said \u201cKnow God; know peace.\u201d In this verse, he says \u201cNo God; no peace.\u201d A person who has not learnt to discipline the mind and senses can neither meditate upon God nor experience his divine bliss. Without the higher taste, it becomes impossible to renounce the lower taste, and such a person keeps hankering for material happiness, like the bee finds it impossible to renounce the nectar of the flower:r\u0101trirgami\u1e63hyati bhavi\u1e63hyati suprabh\u0101ta\u1e41bh\u0101sv\u0101nudve\u1e63hyati hasi\u1e63hyati pa\u1e45kaja\u015bhr\u012b\u1e25eva\u1e41 vichintayati ko\u1e63ha gate dvirepheh\u0101 hanta hanta nalin\u012b\u1e41 gaja ujjah\u0101ra (Sukti Sudhakar) ][v56]This popular verse in Sanskrit literature relates a bee\u2019s story. The bee was sitting on a lotus flower, drinking its nectar. As the sun began setting, the petals of the flower began shutting. But the bee was so attached to enjoying the object of its senses that it refused to fly off. It thought, \u201cThere is still time for the flower to close. Let me suck some more nectar while I can.\u201d In the same way, we can see old age coming as a sure sign of death, but like the bee, we remain engrossed in enjoying worldly pleasures.In the meantime, it became dark and the lotus flower closed, trapping the bee. It thought, \u201cNever mind! Let me remain inside my beloved flower for tonight. Tomorrow morning, when its petals open again, I will fly away.\u201d K\u0101\u1e63h\u1e6dha bhedo nipu\u1e47opi sang\u1e5bih\u012b ku\u1e47\u1e6dhito bhavati padma vibhede [v57] \u201cA bee has the power to cut through wood. But look at the attachment to the sense objects that the bee which can cut through wood is stuck inside the soft petals of the lotus.\u201d In the meantime, an elephant came, broke the lotus from the stem, and swallowed it. The bee along with the lotus went into the stomach of the elephant. The bee was thinking, \u201cMy beloved lotus is going somewhere, and I am happily going along with it.\u201d It died shortly thereafter.Similarly, we humans too remain engrossed in the gratification of the senses, and do not heed to the message of the Saints to engage in devotion to God. Finally, time overtakes us in the form of death. Here, Shree Krishna says that those who refuse to discipline the senses and engage in devotion continue to be rocked by the three-fold miseries of Maya. Material desires are like an itching eczema, and the more we indulge in them, the worse they become. How can we be truly happy in this state of material indulgence?\n",

    "new_commentary": "This commentary on the Bhagavad Gita focuses on the importance of discipline, meditation, and devotion to God in order to find peace and divine bliss. The verse emphasizes that without disciplining the mind and senses, it is impossible to experience God's presence or renounce material desires. The story of the bee and the lotus flower serves as an analogy to highlight the attachment to worldly pleasures and the consequences of ignoring the spiritual path. The bee's attachment leads to its entrapment and death, symbolizing the outcome of remaining engrossed in sensory gratification. The commentary concludes by stating that those who do not discipline their senses and engage in devotion continue to suffer the miseries of Maya, as material desires only worsen over time. True happiness can only be attained through spiritual practices and detachment from material indulgence.",
