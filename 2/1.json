    "commentary": "\nTo describe Arjun\u2019s feelings, Sanjay uses the word k\u1e5bipay\u0101, meaning pity or compassion.\u00a0 This compassion is of two kinds.\u00a0 One is the divine compassion that God and the saints feel toward the souls in the material realm, on seeing their suffering in separation to God.\u00a0 The other is the material compassion that we feel upon seeing the bodily distress of others.\u00a0 Material compassion is a noble sentiment that is not perfectly directed.\u00a0 It is like being obsessed with the health of the car while the driver sitting within is famished for food.\u00a0 Arjun is experiencing this second kind of sentiment.\u00a0 He is overwhelmed with material pity toward his enemies gathered for battle.\u00a0 The fact that Arjun is overcome by grief and despair shows that he is himself in dire need of compassion.\u00a0 Therefore, the idea of his being merciful upon others is meaningless.In this verse, Shree Krishna is addressed as \u201cMadhusudan.\u201d\u00a0 He had slayed the demon Madhu, and hence gotten the name Madhusudan, or \u201cslayer of the Madhu demon.\u201d\u00a0 Here, He is about to slay the demon of doubt that has arisen in Arjun\u2019s mind and is preventing him from discharging his duty.\n",
