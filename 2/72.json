    "commentary": "\nBrahman means God, and Br\u0101hm\u012b sthiti means the state of God-realization. When the soul purifies the heart (the mind and intellect are sometimes jointly referred to as the heart), God bestows his divine grace, as mentioned in verse 2.64. By his grace, he grants divine knowledge, divine bliss, and divine love to the soul. All these are divine energies that are given by God to the soul at the time of God-realization.At the same time, he liberates the soul from the bondage of Maya. The sa\u00f1chit karmas (account of karmas of endless lifetimes) are destroyed. The avidy\u0101, ignorance within, from endless lifetimes in the material world, is dispelled. The influence of tri-gu\u1e47as, three modes of material nature, ceases. The tri-do\u1e63has, three defects of the materially conditioned state come to an end. The pa\u00f1ch-kle\u015bhas, five defects of the material intellect, are destroyed. The pa\u00f1ch-ko\u015bhas, five sheaths of the material energy, are burnt. And from that point onward, the soul becomes free from the bondage of Maya for the rest of eternity.When this state of God-realization is achieved, the soul is said to be j\u012bvan mukt, or liberated even while residing in the body. Then, at the time of death, the liberated soul finally discards the corporeal body, and it reaches the Supreme Abode of God. The Rig Veda states:tadvi\u1e63h\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015bhyanti s\u016braya\u1e25 (1.22.20) [v60]\u201cOnce the soul attains God, it always remains in union with him. After that, the ignorance of Maya can never overpower it again.\u201d That state of eternal liberation from Maya is also called nirv\u0101\u1e47, mok\u1e63ha, etc. As a result, liberation is a natural consequence of God-realization.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In the commentary, it is explained that when the soul purifies the heart, God bestows divine grace upon it, granting divine knowledge, bliss, and love. This liberation from Maya includes the destruction of past karmas, dispelling ignorance, and ceasing the influence of material nature. The soul becomes free from the bondage of Maya for eternity. This state of God-realization is known as j\u012bvan mukt, where the liberated soul resides in the body. At death, the soul discards the body and reaches the Supreme Abode of God. The Rig Veda emphasizes that once the soul attains God, it remains united with Him forever, free from the ignorance of Maya. This eternal liberation is also referred to as nirv\u0101\u1e47 and mok\u1e63ha, making liberation a natural consequence of God-realization.",
    "newest_commentary": "In the commentary, it is explained that purifying the heart allows the soul to receive divine grace, knowledge, bliss, and love. This liberation involves destroying past karmas, dispelling ignorance, and transcending material nature. The soul becomes eternally free from the bondage of Maya, experiencing j\u012bvan mukt, God-realization while still in the body. After death, the soul discards the body and reaches the Supreme Abode. The Rig Veda emphasizes the soul's union with God, free from the ignorance of Maya. This eternal liberation, known as nirv\u0101\u1e47 and mok\u1e63ha, is a natural outcome of God-realization."
