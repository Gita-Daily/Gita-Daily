    "translation": "Flowery speech is uttered by the unwise, taking pleasure in the eulogising words of the Vedas, O Arjuna, saying, \"There is nothing else.\"Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, (they utter speech which is directed to ends) leading to new births as the result of their works, and prescribe various methods abounding in specific actions, for the attainment of pleasure and power.",
    "commentary": "\nThe Vedas are divided into three sections. These are: Karm-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d (ritualistic ceremonies), J\u00f1\u0101na-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0da (knowledge section), and Up\u0101san\u0101-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d (devotional section). The Karm-k\u0101\u1e47\u1e0d section advocates the performance of ritualistic ceremonies for material rewards and promotion to the celestial abodes. Those who seek sensual pleasures glorify this section of the Vedas.The celestial abodes contain a higher order of material luxuries, and offer greater facility for sensual enjoyment. But elevation to the heavenly abodes does not imply a concurrent spiritual elevation. These celestial planes are also within the material universe, and having gone there, when one\u2019s account of good karmas gets depleted, one again returns to the planet Earth. People with limited understanding strive for the heavenly abodes, thinking that is the whole purpose of the Vedas. In this way, they continue transmigrating in the cycle of life-and-death, without endeavoring for God-realization. However, those with spiritual wisdom do not make even heaven their goal. The Mu\u1e47\u1e0dakopani\u1e63had states:avidy\u0101y\u0101mantare vartam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 svaya\u1e41dh\u012br\u0101\u1e25 pa\u1e47\u1e0dita\u1e41 manyam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25ja\u1e45ghanyam\u0101n\u0101\u1e25 pariyanti m\u016b\u1e0dh\u0101 andhenaiva n\u012byam\u0101n\u0101 yath\u0101ndh\u0101\u1e25 (1.2.8) [v37]\u201cThose, who practice the ostentatious rituals prescribed in the Vedas for enjoying the celestial pleasures of the higher abodes, think themselves to be scholars of the scriptures, but in reality they are foolish. They are like the blind leading the blind.\u201d\n",
