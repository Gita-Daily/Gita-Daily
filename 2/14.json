    "translation": "The contacts of the senses with the objects, O son of Kunti, which cause heat and cold, pleasure and pain, have a beginning and an end; they are impermanent; endure them bravely, O Arjuna.",
    "commentary": "\nThe human body houses five senses\u2014the senses of sight, smell, taste, touch, and hearing\u2014and these, in contact with their objects of perception, give rise to sensations of happiness and distress. None of these sensations is permanent. They come and go like the changing seasons. Although cool water provides pleasure in the summer, the same water gives distress in the winter. Thus, both the perceptions of happiness and distress experienced through the senses are transitory. If we permit ourselves to be affected by them, we will sway like a pendulum from side to side. A person of discrimination should practice to tolerate both the feelings of happiness and distress without being disturbed by them.The technique of Vipassan\u0101, which is the primary technique of self-realization in Buddhism, is based on this principle of tolerance of sense perceptions. Its practice helps eliminate desire, which, as stated in the four noble truths (the truth of suffering, the truth of the origin of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, and the truth of the path leading to the cessation), is the cause of all suffering. This is not surprising considering that Buddhist philosophy is a subset of the vast Vedic philosophy.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary highlights the transitory nature of sensations of happiness and distress experienced through the five senses. It emphasizes that if we allow ourselves to be affected by these sensations, we will constantly sway between pleasure and pain. The practice of Vipassan\u0101 in Buddhism is based on the principle of tolerating sense perceptions to eliminate desire, which is the cause of suffering. This aligns with the four noble truths of Buddhism. The commentary also mentions that Buddhist philosophy is a subset of the vast Vedic philosophy.",
    "newest_commentary": "The commentary explores the transient nature of happiness and distress experienced through the five senses. It highlights the need to not be swayed by these sensations to avoid constantly oscillating between pleasure and pain. It draws a parallel between the practice of Vipassan\u0101 in Buddhism and the elimination of desire, which is the cause of suffering according to the four noble truths. Additionally, the commentary acknowledges the connection between Buddhist philosophy and Vedic philosophy, stating that Buddhism is a subset of the broader Vedic tradition."
