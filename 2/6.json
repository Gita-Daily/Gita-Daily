Arjun was debating whether it would be desirable to defeat the Kauravas or to be defeated by them. Both alternatives seemed like defeat, for if he did win the war by slaying the Kauravas, he would have no further desire to live.However, the fact was that Bheeshma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, etc. had acted ignobly by taking the side of the unrighteous Kauravas. The word arthak\u0101m has been used for them, implying, \u201cattached to wealth and position,\u201d they had taken the side of the wicked Duryodhan. So, killing them in the war was a natural consequence. In fact, after the war, Bheeshma himself admitted that a teacher who acts ignobly is fit to be abandoned.Here, special mention needs to be made of Bheeshma. According to the \u015ahr\u012bmad Bh\u0101gavatam (verse 9.22.19), he was a great devotee of Shree Krishna. He was a master of his senses, and an icon of chivalry and generosity. He was a knower of the Absolute Truth, and had vowed to always speak the truth in his life. Even death could only come to him when he chose to accept it. For various reasons, he is enumerated amongst the twelve great personalities, or Mah\u0101jans, mentioned in the Bh\u0101gavatam:swayambh\u016br n\u0101rada\u1e25 \u015bhambhu\u1e25 kum\u0101ra\u1e25 kapilo manu\u1e25prahl\u0101do janako bh\u012b\u1e63hmo balir vaiy\u0101sakir vayam (6.3.20) [v1]\u201cThese are the twelve great knowers of religious principles\u2014the first-born Brahma, Sage Narad, Lord Shiv, the four Kumars, Bhagavan Kapil (son of Devahuti), Svayambhuva Manu, Prahlad Maharaj, Janak Maharaj, Grandfather Bheeshma, Bali Maharaj, Shukadev Muni, and Ved Vyas.\u201dHence, Bheeshma was an enlightened soul, whose actions could never be against the principles of dharma. However, his profound character was beyond mundane reasoning. Even though he fought on the side of the Kauravas, he said to Yudhishthir (the eldest of the Pandava brothers) before the war, \u201cI am obliged to combat on the side of unrighteousness, but I give you the boon that you will be victorious.\u201d Bheeshma knew that the righteous Pandavas, who had the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna on their side, could never lose. By taking the side of adharma (unrighteousness), he showed that even the biggest forces on heaven and earth could not make unholiness win in this holy war. He thus offered the biggest sacrifice of laying down his life, to assist the divine pastimes of Lord Krishna.Shree Krishna was well aware of Bheeshma\u2019s deep devotion toward him, despite his fighting from the side of the Kauravas. That is why he upheld Bheeshma\u2019s vow by breaking his own. Bheeshma resolved on a particular day during the war, that before sunset on the next day, he would either kill Arjun, the foremost Pandava warrior, or else to save him, Shree Krishna would have to break his own vow of not lifting weapons in the battle of Mahabharat. Poets describe the vow that Bheeshma made:\u0101ju jo harihi\u1e45 na \u015bhastra gah\u0101\u016b\u00f1,tau l\u0101jahu\u00f1 ga\u1e45g\u0101 janan\u012b ko \u015bh\u0101ntanu suta na kah\u0101\u016b\u00f1(Saint Tulsidas) [v2]\u201cIf I do not make the Supreme Lord Shree Krishna lift weapons, then I will shame my mother Ganga, and I am not the son of King Shantanu.\u201d Bheeshma fought so valiantly that Arjun\u2019s chariot was shattered, and he was stranded on the ground. At that stage, Shree Krishna lifted the chariot wheel and came forward to prevent Bheeshma from killing Arjun. Bheeshma saw the Lord with the chariot wheel in his hand as a weapon, and broke into a big smile. He understood that Bhaktavatsala Bhagav\u0101n (God who gives pleasure to his devotees) had broken his own vow to honor the vow of his devotee.In fact, Bheeshma\u2019s devotion to Lord Krishna had a very rasik (full of sweetness) flavor to it. He used to meditate on Shree Krishna\u2019s pastimes in Vrindavan. There, in the evening when the Lord would return to the village after grazing the cows in the forest, the dust raised from the hooves of the cows would deck his charming face, increasing its beauty and sweetness. During the battle of Mahabharat, the dust raised from the hooves of the horses too added to Shree Krishna\u2019s beauty, and he loved having dar\u015bhan (divine vision) of his Lord there.In the last stage of his life, as he lay for six months on the bed of arrows, he meditated on that very vision of God, offering the following prayer to Him:yudhi turaga-rajo-vidh\u016bmra-vi\u1e63hvak-kacha-lulita-\u015bhramav\u0101ry-ala\u1e45k\u1e5bit\u0101syemama ni\u015bhita-\u015bharair vibhidyam\u0101na-tvachi vilasat-kavache \u2019stu k\u1e5bi\u1e63h\u1e47a \u0101tm\u0101(Bh\u0101gavatam 1.9.34) [v3]\u201cOn the battlefield, Lord Krishna\u2019s flowing hair was covered with white dust raised by the hooves of the horses, and his face was covered with sweat beads because of his physical effort in driving the chariot. These were like ornaments enhancing the beauty of my Lord; and the wounds dealt by my sharp arrows further intensified the decorations. Let my mind meditate unto that Shree Krishna.\u201dLord Krishna reciprocated his loving devotion by himself coming to meet Bheeshma on his deathbed of arrows, and with the dar\u015bhan of God in front of him, Bheeshma, the great mah\u0101jan, left his body, of his own volition.\n", "next shlok": 7}
