    "commentary": "\nOn the gate of the temple of Apollo at Delphi are inscribed the words, Gnothi Seuton, or \u201cKnow Thyself [v8].\u201d Even Socrates, the wise old man of Athens, was fond of encouraging people to inquire into the nature of the self. A local legend goes like this. Once, Socrates was walking on the street, absorbed in deep philosophic contemplation, when he accidentally bumped into someone. That man blurted in annoyance, \u201cCan\u2019t you see where you walk? Who are you?\u201d Socrates answered with amusement, \u201cMy dear fellow, I have been pondering over that question for the last forty years. If you ever come to know who I am, please let me know.\u201dIn the Vedic tradition, whenever divine knowledge is imparted, it usually begins with knowledge of the self. Shree Krishna follows the same approach in the Bhagavad Gita, with a piece of information that would have swept Socrates off his feet. Shree Krishna begins by explaining that the entity that we call the \u201cself\u201d is really the soul, not the material body, and is eternal, just as God himself is eternal. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states:j\u00f1\u0101j\u00f1au dw\u0101vaj\u0101 v\u012b\u015bhan\u012b\u015bh\u0101vaj\u0101 hyek\u0101 bhokt\u1e5bi bhogy\u0101rtha yukt\u0101ananta\u015bhch\u0101tm\u0101 vi\u015bhwar\u016bpo hyakart\u0101 traya\u1e41 yad\u0101 vindate brahmametat (1.9) [v9]The above verse states that creation is a combination of three entities\u2014God, soul, and Maya\u2014and all the three entities are eternal. If we believe the soul is eternal, then it follows logically that there is life after death of the material body. Shree Krishna talks about this in the next verse.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The commentary discusses the concept of self-knowledge and the eternal nature of the soul in the Bhagavad Gita. It references the inscription on the temple of Apollo, emphasizing the importance of knowing oneself. Socrates' encounter with a question about his identity is recounted, highlighting the pursuit of self-understanding. In the Vedic tradition, divine knowledge starts with understanding the self. Shree Krishna reveals that the 'self' is the eternal soul, separate from the material body. The \u015ahwet\u0101\u015bhvatar Upani\u1e63had states that creation consists of God, soul, and Maya, all of which are eternal. This implies the existence of life after death. The commentary concludes by mentioning that Shree Krishna further explains this concept in the following verse."
