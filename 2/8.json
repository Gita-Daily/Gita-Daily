    "commentary": "\nWhen we are swamped in misery, the intellect keeps analyzing the cause of misery, and when it is able to think no further, then dejection sets in. Since Arjun\u2019s problems are looming bigger than his feeble intellectual abilities, his material knowledge is insufficient in saving him from the ocean of grief that he finds himself in. Having accepted Shree Krishna as his Guru, Arjun now pours out his heart to him, to reveal his pitiable state.Arjun\u2019s situation is not unique. This is invariably the situation we sometimes find ourselves in as we go through the journey of life. We want happiness, but we experience misery; we desire knowledge, but are unable to lift the cloud of ignorance; we crave perfect love, but repeatedly meet with disappointment. Our college degrees, acquired knowledge, and mundane scholarships do not provide solutions to these perplexities of life. We need divine knowledge to solve the puzzle of life. That treasure chest of divine knowledge is opened when we find a true Guru, one who is situated in transcendence, provided we have the humility to learn from him. Such is the path Arjun has decided to take.\n",

We often desire happiness, knowledge, and love, but find ourselves surrounded by misery, ignorance, and disappointment. Our worldly knowledge and achievements do not provide solutions to these challenges. To overcome them, we need divine knowledge, which can be obtained through a true Guru who is situated in transcendence. Arjun has chosen this path, recognizing the need for humility and willingness to learn. In this quest for divine knowledge, we find the key to unraveling the mysteries of life.",
