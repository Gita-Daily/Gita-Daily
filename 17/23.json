    "commentary": "\nIn this chapter, Shree Krishna explained the categories of yaj\u00f1a (sacrifice), tapa\u1e25 (austerity), and d\u0101n (charity), according to the three modes of material nature. Amongst these three modes, the mode of ignorance degrades the soul into nescience, languor, and sloth. The mode of passion excites the living being and binds it in innumerable desires. The mode of goodness is serene and illuminating, and engenders the development of virtues. Yet, the mode of goodness is also within the realm of Maya. We must not get attached to it; instead, we must use the mode of goodness as a stepping-stone to reach the transcendental platform. In this verse, Shree Krishna goes beyond the three gu\u1e47as, and discusses the words Om Tat Sat, which symbolize different aspects of the Absolute Truth. In the following verses, he explains the significance of these three words.\n",

    "newest_commentary": "Shree Krishna explains the categories of sacrifice, austerity, and charity based on the three modes of material nature. The mode of ignorance leads to nescience and sloth, while the mode of passion creates endless desires. The mode of goodness is serene and promotes virtue but should not be attached to. The verse goes beyond the three modes and discusses the words Om Tat Sat, representing aspects of the Absolute Truth. Subsequent verses explain the significance of these words."
