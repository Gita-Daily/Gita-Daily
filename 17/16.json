    "commentary": "\nAusterity of the mind is higher than the austerity of body and speech, for if we learn to master the mind, the body and speech automatically get mastered, while the reverse is not necessarily true. Factually, the state of the mind determines the state of an individual\u2019s consciousness. Shree Krishna had stated in verse 6.5, \u201cElevate yourself through the power of your mind and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self.\u201dThe mind may be likened to a garden, which can either be intelligently cultivated or allowed to run wild. Gardeners cultivate their plot, growing fruits, flowers, and vegetables in it. At the same time, they also ensure that it remains free from weeds. Similarly, we must cultivate our own mind with rich and noble thoughts, while weeding out the negative and debilitating thoughts. If we allow resentful, hateful, blaming, unforgiving, critical, and condemning thoughts to reside in our mind, they will have a debilitating effect on our personality. We can never get a fair amount of constructive action out of the mind until we have learned to control it and keep it from becoming stimulated by anger, hatred, dislike, etc. These are the weeds that choke out the manifestation of divine grace within our hearts.People imagine that their thoughts are secret and have no external consequences because they dwell within the mind, away from the sight of others. They do not realize that thoughts not only forge their inner character but also their external personality. That is why we look upon someone and say, \u201cHe seems like a very simple and trustworthy person.\u201d For another person, we say, \u201cShe seems to be very cunning and deceitful. Stay away from her.\u201d In each case, it was the thoughts people harbored that sculpted their appearance. Ralph Waldo Emerson said: \u201cThere is full confession in the glances of our eyes, in our smiles, in salutations, in the grasp of the hands. Our sin bedaubs us, mars all the good impressions. Men do not know why they do not trust us. The vice glasses the eyes, demeans the cheek, pinches the nose, and writes, \u2018O fool, fool!\u2019 on the forehead of a king.\u201d Another powerful saying linking thoughts to character states:\u201cWatch your thoughts, for they become words.Watch your words, for they become actions.Watch your actions, for they become habits.Watch your habits, for they become character.Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny.\u201dIt is important to realize that we harm ourselves with every negative thought that we harbor in our mind. At the same time, we uplift ourselves with every positive thought that we dwell upon. Henry Van Dyke expressed this very vividly, in his poem \u201cThoughts are things.\u201dI hold it true that thoughts are things;They\u2019re endowed with bodies and breath and wingsThat which we call our secret thoughtSpeeds forth to earth\u2019s remotest spot,Leaving its blessings or its woes,Like tracks behind as it goes.We build our future, thought by thought.For good or ill, yet know it not,Choose, then, thy destiny and wait,For love brings love, and hate brings hate.Each thought we dwell upon has consequences, and thought-by-thought, we forge our destiny. For this reason, to veer the mind from negative emotions and make it dwell upon the positive sentiments is considered austerity of the mind.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The mind, when mastered, controls the body and speech. Cultivating a positive mind is essential to prevent negative thoughts from affecting our personality and actions. Our thoughts not only shape our character but also reflect in our appearance and how others perceive us. Negative thoughts harm us, while positive thoughts uplift us. It is crucial to watch our thoughts, as they become words, actions, habits, and ultimately our destiny. Each thought has consequences, and we build our future thought by thought. Therefore, practicing austerity of the mind involves redirecting negative emotions and focusing on positive sentiments.",
