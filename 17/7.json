    "commentary": "\nThe mind and body impact each other. Thus, the food people eat influences their nature and vice versa. The Chhāndogya Upaniṣhad explains that the coarsest part of the food we eat passes out as feces; the subtler part becomes flesh; and the subtlest part becomes the mind (6.5.1). Again, it states: āhāra śhuddhau sattva śhuddhiḥ  (7.26.2)[v1] “By eating pure food, the mind becomes pure.” The reverse is also true—people with pure minds prefer pure foods.\n",
