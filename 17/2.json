Those who do not believe in the scriptures are also not bereft of faith. Their faith is reposed elsewhere. It could be on the logical ability of their intellect, or the perceptions of their senses, or the theories they have decided to believe in. For example, when people say, \u201cI do not believe in God because I cannot see him,\u201d they do not have faith in God but they have faith in their eyes. Hence, they assume that if their eyes cannot see something, it probably does not exist. This is also a kind of faith. Others say, \u201cI do not believe in the authenticity of the ancient scriptures. Instead I accept the theories of modern science.\u201d This is also a kind of faith, for we have seen in the last few centuries how theories of science keep getting amended and overthrown. It is possible that the present scientific theories we believe to be true may also be proved incorrect in the future. Accepting them as truths is also a leap of faith. Prof. Charles H. Townes, Nobel Prize winner in Physics, expressed this very nicely: \u201cScience itself requires faith. We don\u2019t know if our logic is correct. I don\u2019t know if you are there. You don\u2019t know if I am here. We may just be imagining all this. I have a faith that the world is what it seems like, and thus I believe you are there. I can\u2019t prove it from any fundamental point of view\u2026 Yet I have to accept a certain framework in which to operate. The idea that \u2018religion is faith\u2019 and \u2018science is knowledge,\u2019 I think, is quite wrong. We scientists believe in the existence of the external world and the validity of our own logic. We feel quite comfortable about it. Nevertheless these are acts of faith. We can\u2019t prove them.\u201d Whether one is a material scientist, a social scientist, or a spiritual scientist, one cannot avoid the leap of faith required in the acceptance of knowledge. Shree Krishna now explains the reason why different people choose to place their faith in different places.\n", "next shlok": 3}
