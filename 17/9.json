While describing them, the word \u201cvery\u201d can be added to all the adjectives used. Thus, r\u0101jasic foods are very bitter, very sour, very salty, very hot, very pungent, very dry, full of chillies, etc. They produce ill-health, agitation, and despair. Persons in the mode of passion find such foods attractive, but those in the mode of goodness find them disgusting. The purpose of eating is not to relish bliss through the palate, but to keep the body healthy and strong. As the old adage states: \u201cEat to live; do not live to eat.\u201d Thus, the wise partake of foods that are conducive to good health, and have a peaceable impact upon the mind i.e., s\u0101ttvic foods.\n", "next shlok": 10}
