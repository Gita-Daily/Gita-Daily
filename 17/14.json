    "commentary": "\nThe word tapa\u1e25 means \u201cto heat up,\u201d e.g. by placing on fire. In the process of purification, metals are heated and melted, so that the impurities may rise to the top and be removed. When gold is placed in the fire, its impurities get burnt and its luster increases. Similarly, the Vedas state: atapta tanurnatad\u0101 mo\u015bhnute (Rig Veda 9.83.1)[v3] \u201cWithout purifying the body through austerity, one cannot reach the final state of yog.\u201d By sincerely practicing austerity, human beings can uplift and transform their lives from the mundane to the divine. Such austerity should be performed without show, with pure intent, in a peaceable manner, in conformance with the guidance of the spiritual master and the scriptures.Shree Krishna now classifies such austerity into three categories\u2014of the body, speech, and mind. In this verse, he talks of the austerity of the body. When the body is dedicated to the service of the pure and saintly, and all sense indulgence in general, and sexual indulgence in particular, is eschewed, it is acclaimed as austerity of the body. Such austerity should be done with cleanliness, simplicity, and care for not hurting others. Here, \u201cBrahmins\u201d does not refer to those who consider themselves Brahmins by birth, but to those endowed with s\u0101ttvic qualities, as described in verse 18.42.\n",

    "new_commentary": "The word tapa\u1e25 means 'to heat up' and signifies the purification process, where impurities rise and are removed. Austerity is vital for spiritual progress, as stated in the Vedas. By practicing austerity sincerely, one can elevate their life from mundane to divine. Shree Krishna classifies austerity into three categories: body, speech, and mind. This verse focuses on body austerity, which involves dedicating the body to serving the pure and saintly, abstaining from sensual and sexual indulgence. It should be performed with cleanliness, simplicity, and care not to harm others. The term 'Brahmins' refers to those possessing sattvic qualities rather than birth status.",
