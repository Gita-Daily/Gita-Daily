Impelled by desire and attachment, they torment not only the elements of their body, but also I who dwell within them as the Supreme Soul. Know these senseless people to be of demoniacal resolves.\r\n                        \n",
    "commentary": "\nIn the name of spirituality, people perform senseless austerities. Some lie on beds of thorns or drive spikes through their bodies as a part of macabre rituals for dominion over material existence. Others keep one hand raised for years, as a procedure they believe will help them gain mystic abilities. Some gaze constantly at the sun, unmindful of the harm it does to their eyes. Others undertake long fasts, withering their body away for imagined material gains. Shree Krishna says: \u201cO Arjun, you asked me about the status of those who disregard the injunctions of the scriptures and yet worship with faith. I am telling you that faith is visible even in people who perform severe austerities, but it is bereft of a proper basis of knowledge. Such people do possess deep conviction in the efficacy of their practices, but their faith is in the mode of ignorance. Those who abuse and torture their own physical body disrespect the Supreme Soul who resides within. All these are contrary to the recommended path of the scriptures.\u201d\nHaving described the three categories of faith, Shree Krishna now explains, corresponding to each of these, the categories of food, activities, sacrifice, charity, and so forth.\n",

    "new_commentary": "In this commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, it is stated that many people engage in extreme and senseless austerities in the name of spirituality. They subject themselves to painful rituals and self-inflicted harm, believing it will grant them material dominion or mystic abilities. Shree Krishna explains to Arjuna that although these individuals may have faith, it lacks a proper basis of knowledge and is in the mode of ignorance. Their actions disrespect the Supreme Soul residing within them. Shree Krishna further describes the three categories of faith and how they relate to food, activities, sacrifice, charity, and more. The recommended path of the scriptures is contrary to these extreme practices."
