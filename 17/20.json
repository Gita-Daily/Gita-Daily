    "commentary": "\nThe three-fold divisions of d\u0101nam, or charity, are now being described. It is an act of duty to give according to one\u2019s capacity. The Bhavi\u1e63hya Pur\u0101\u1e47 states: d\u0101nameka\u1e41 kalau yuge [v5] \u201cIn the age of Kali, giving in charity is the means for purification.\u201d The Ramayan states this too:praga\u1e6da ch\u0101ri pada dharma ke kali mahu\u00f1 ek pradh\u0101najena kena bidhi d\u012bnhe\u1e45 d\u0101na karai kaly\u0101na [v6]\u201cDharma has four basic tenets, one amongst which is the most important in the age of Kali\u2014give in charity by whatever means possible.\u201d The act of charity bestows many benefits. It reduces the attachment of the giver toward material objects; it develops the attitude of service; it expands the heart, and fosters the sentiment of compassion for others. Hence, most religious traditions follow the injunction of giving away one-tenth of one\u2019s earnings in charity. The Skandh Pur\u0101\u1e47 states:ny\u0101yop\u0101rjita vittasya da\u015bham\u0101n\u015bhena dh\u012bmata\u1e25kartavyo viniyoga\u015bhcha \u012b\u015bhvaraprityarthameva cha [v7]\u201cFrom the wealth you have earned by rightful means, take out one-tenth, and as a matter of duty, give it away in charity. Dedicate your charity for the pleasure of God.\u201d Charity is classified as proper or improper, superior or inferior, according to the factors mentioned by Shree Krishna in this verse. When it is offered freely from the heart to worthy recipients, at the proper time, and at the appropriate place, it is bequeathed to be in the mode of goodness.\n",
