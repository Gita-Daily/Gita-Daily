    "commentary": "\nIn Chapter 14, verse 6, Shree Krishna had explained that the mode of goodness is pure, illuminating, and serene, and creates a sense of happiness and satisfaction. Foods in the mode of goodness have the same effect. In the above verse, these foods are described with the words \u0101yu\u1e25 sattva, meaning \u201cwhich promote longevity.\u201d They bestow good health, virtue, happiness, and satisfaction. Such foods are juicy, naturally tasteful, mild, and beneficial. These include grains, pulses, beans, fruits, vegetables, milk, and other vegetarian foods.Hence, a vegetarian diet is beneficial for cultivating the qualities of the mode of goodness that are conducive for spiritual life. Numerous s\u0101ttvic (influenced by the mode of goodness) thinkers and philosophers in history have echoed this sentiment:\u201cVegetarianism is a greater progress. From the greater clearness of head and quicker apprehension motivated him to become a vegetarian. Flesh-eating is an unprovoked murder.\u201d Benjamin Franklin\u201cIs it not a reproach that man is a carnivorous animal? True, he can and does live, in a great measure, by preying on other animals; but this is a miserable way. I have no doubt that it is a part of the destiny of the human race, in its gradual improvement, to leave off eating animals, as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other when they came in contact with the more civilized.\u201d Henry David Thoreau in \u201cWalden\u201d\u201cIt is necessary to correct the error that vegetarianism has made us weak in mind, or passive or inert in action. I do not regard flesh-food as necessary at any stage.\u201d Mahatma Gandhi.\u201cO my fellow men, do not defile your bodies with sinful foods. We have corn and we have apples bending down the branches with their weight. There are vegetables that can be cooked and softened over the fire. The earth affords a lavish supply of riches, of innocent foods, and offers you banquets that involve no bloodshed or slaughter; only beasts satisfy their hunger with flesh, and not even all of those, because horses, cattle, and sheep live on grass.\u201d Pythagoras\u201cI do not want to make my stomach a graveyard of dead animals.\u201d George Bernard ShawEven amongst violence against animals, killing of the cow is particularly heinous. The cow provides milk for human consumption, and so it is like a mother to human beings. To kill the mother cow when it is no longer capable of giving milk is an insensitive, uncultured, and ungrateful act.\n",

Many thinkers and philosophers throughout history advocate for vegetarianism, believing that it promotes clarity of mind and compassion. Benjamin Franklin, Henry David Thoreau, Mahatma Gandhi, Pythagoras, and George Bernard Shaw all express the belief that vegetarianism is morally superior. Among all acts of violence against animals, killing cows is seen as particularly heinous. Cows are regarded as mothers to humans, providing milk for consumption. Killing a cow when it is no longer productive is deemed insensitive and ungrateful.",
